If this is your first watch—hi, I’m Nick! TLDR: I spent five years building automated businesses with Make.com (most notably 1SecondCopy, a content company that hit 7 figures). Today a lot of people talk about automation, but I’ve noticed that very few have practical, real world success making money with it. So this channel is me chiming in and showing you what real systems that make real revenue look like! Hopefully I can help you improve your business, and in doing so, the rest of your life :-) Please like, subscribe, and leave me a comment if you have a specific request!

His father made him president of the family real estate business in 1971. Trump renamed it the Trump Organization and reoriented the company toward building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After a series of business failures in the late 1990s, he launched side ventures, mostly licensing the Trump name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice. He and his businesses have been plaintiffs or defendants in more than 4,000 legal actions, including six business bankruptcies. \nTrump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote.[a] The Mueller special counsel investigation determined that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to favor Trump. During the campaign, his political positions were described as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. He was the only U.S. president without prior military or government experience. Trump promoted conspiracy theories and made many false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged, racist, and misogynistic. \nAs president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. He rolled back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations. He signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut taxes and eliminated the individual health insurance mandate penalty of the Affordable Care Act. He appointed Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. He reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials, used political pressure to interfere with testing efforts, and spread misinformation about unproven treatments. Trump initiated a trade war with China and withdrew the U.S. from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times but made no progress on denuclearization. \nTrump is the only U.S. president to have been impeached twice, in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress after he pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection. The Senate acquitted him in both cases. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Biden but refused to concede. He falsely claimed widespread electoral fraud and attempted to overturn the results. On January 6, 2021, he urged his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol, which many of them attacked. Scholars and historians rank Trump as one of the worst presidents in American history. \nSince leaving office, Trump has continued to dominate the Republican Party and is their candidate again in the 2024 presidential election, having chosen as his running mate U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio. In May 2024, a jury in New York found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels in an attempt to influence the 2016 election, making him the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime. He has been indicted in three other jurisdictions on 54 other felony counts related to his mishandling of classified documents and for efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. In civil proceedings, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in 2023, defamation in 2024, and financial fraud in 2024. \nPersonal life\nEarly life\nTrump at the New York Military Academy, 1964 \nTrump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York City,[1] the fourth child of Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. He grew up with older siblings Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth and younger brother Robert in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens, and attended the private Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade.[2][3][4] He went to Sunday school and was confirmed in 1959 at the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens.[5][6] At age 13, he entered the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school.[7] In 1964, he enrolled at Fordham University. Two years later, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics.[8][9] In 2015, Trump's lawyer threatened Trump's colleges, his high school, and the College Board with legal action if they released his academic records.[10] \nWhile in college, Trump obtained four student draft deferments during the Vietnam War.[11] In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based on a medical examination, and in July 1968, a local draft board classified him as eligible to serve.[12] In October 1968, he was classified 1-Y, a conditional medical deferment,[13] and in 1972, he was reclassified 4-F, unfit for military service, due to bone spurs, permanently disqualifying him.[14] \nFamily\nIn 1977, Trump married Czech model Ivana Zelníčková.[15] They had three children: Donald Jr. (born 1977), Ivanka (1981), and Eric (1984). The couple divorced in 1990, following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples.[16] Trump and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter, Tiffany (born 1993), who was raised by Maples in California.[17] In 2005, Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss.[18] They have one son, Barron (born 2006).[19] \nReligion\nIn the 1970s, Trump's parents joined the Marble Collegiate Church, part of the Reformed Church in America.[5][20] In 2015, he said he was a Presbyterian and attended Marble Collegiate Church; the church said he was not an active member.[6] In 2019, he appointed his personal pastor, televangelist Paula White, to the White House Office of Public Liaison.[21] In 2020, he said he identified as a non-denominational Christian.[22] \nHealth habits\nTrump says he has never drunk alcohol, smoked cigarettes, or used drugs.[23][24] He sleeps about four or five hours a night.[25][26] He has called golfing his \"primary form of exercise\" but usually does not walk the course.[27] He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes the body is \"like a battery, with a finite amount of energy\", which is depleted by exercise.[28][29] In 2015, Trump's campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein, stating that Trump would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\".[30] In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three of Trump's agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on the doctor's office.[30][31] \nWealth\nTrump (far right) and wife Ivana in the receiving line of a state dinner for King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in 1985, with U.S. president Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan \nIn 1982, Trump made the initial Forbes list of wealthy people for holding a share of his family's estimated $200 million net worth (equivalent to $631 million in 2023).[32] His losses in the 1980s dropped him from the list between 1990 and 1995.[33] After filing the mandatory financial disclosure report with the FEC in July 2015, he announced a net worth of about $10 billion. Records released by the FEC showed at least $1.4 billion in assets and $265 million in liabilities.[34] Forbes estimated his net worth dropped by $1.4 billion between 2015 and 2018.[35] In their 2024 billionaires ranking, Trump's net worth was estimated to be $2.3 billion (1,438th in the world).[36] \nJournalist Jonathan Greenberg reported that Trump called him in 1984, pretending to be a fictional Trump Organization official named \"John Barron\". Greenberg said that Trump, just to get a higher ranking on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans, identified himself as \"Barron\", and then falsely asserted that Donald Trump owned more than 90 percent of his father's business. Greenberg also wrote that Forbes had vastly overestimated Trump's wealth and wrongly included him on the 1982, 1983, and 1984 rankings.[37] \nTrump has often said he began his career with \"a small loan of a million dollars\" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest.[38] He was a millionaire by age eight, borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely failed to repay those loans, and received another $413 million (2018 dollars adjusted for inflation) from his father's company.[39][40] In 2018, he and his family were reported to have committed tax fraud, and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance started an investigation.[40] His investments underperformed the stock and New York property markets.[41][42] Forbes estimated in October 2018 that his net worth declined from $4.5 billion in 2015 to $3.1 billion in 2017 and his product-licensing income from $23 million to $3 million.[43] \nContrary to his claims of financial health and business acumen, Trump's tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17 billion. The losses were higher than those of almost every other American taxpayer. The losses in 1990 and 1991, more than $250 million each year, were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers. In 1995, his reported losses were $915.7 million (equivalent to $1.83 billion in 2023).[44][45][32] \nIn 2020, The New York Times obtained Trump's tax information extending over two decades. Its reporters found that Trump reported losses of hundreds of millions of dollars and had, since 2010, deferred declaring $287 million in forgiven debt as taxable income. His income mainly came from his share in The Apprentice and businesses in which he was a minority partner, and his losses mainly from majority-owned businesses. Much income was in tax credits for his losses, which let him avoid annual income tax payments or lower them to $750. During the 2010s, Trump balanced his businesses' losses by selling and borrowing against assets, including a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower (due in 2022) and the liquidation of over $200 million in stocks and bonds. He personally guaranteed $421 million in debt, most of which is due by 2024.[46] \nAs of October 2021, Trump had over $1.3 billion in debts, much of which is secured by his assets.[47] In 2020, he owed $640 million to banks and trust organizations, including Bank of China, Deutsche Bank, and UBS, and approximately $450 million to unknown creditors. The value of his assets exceeds his debt.[48] \nBusiness career\nReal estate\nTrump in 1985 with a model of one of his aborted Manhattan development projects[49] \nStarting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father's real estate company, Trump Management, which owned racially segregated middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[50][51] In 1971, his father made him president of the company and he began using the Trump Organization as an umbrella brand.[52] Between 1991 and 2009, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses: the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts company.[53] \nManhattan and Chicago developments\nTrump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[54] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for Trump by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan.[51][55] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[56] and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[57] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was Trump's primary residence until 2019.[58][59] \nIn 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of sixteen banks.[60] The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property.[61] In 1995, Trump defaulted on over $3 billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a \"vast and humiliating restructuring\" that allowed Trump to avoid personal bankruptcy.[62][63] The lead bank's attorney said of the banks' decision that they \"all agreed that he'd be better alive than dead.\"[62] \nIn 1996, Trump acquired and renovated the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, later rebranded as the Trump Building.[64] In the early 1990s, Trump won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, Trump sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who financed the project's completion, Riverside South.[65] \nTrump's last major construction project was the 92-story mixed-use Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago) which opened in 2008. In 2024, the New York Times and ProPublica reported that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating whether Trump had twice written off losses incurred through construction cost overruns and lagging sales of residential units in the building Trump had declared tto be worthless on his 2008 tax return.[66][67] \nAtlantic City casinos\nEntrance of the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City \nIn 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza, a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation.[68] It was unprofitable, and Trump paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control.[69] In 1985, Trump bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump Castle.[70] Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992.[71] \nTrump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the Trump Taj Mahal. It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990.[72][73] Trump filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, Trump gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance.[74] To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the Trump Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.[75] \nIn 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza.[76] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10 percent ownership.[68] He remained chairman until 2009.[77] \nClubs\nIn 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[78] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.[79] Trump declared the club his primary residence in 2019.[59] The Trump Organization began building and buying golf courses in 1999.[80] It owns fourteen and manages another three Trump-branded courses worldwide.[80][81] \nLicensing of the Trump brand\nThe Trump name has been licensed for consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, learning courses, and home furnishings.[82][83] According to The Washington Post, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, and they have generated at least $59 million in revenue for his companies.[84] By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.[82] \nSide ventures\nTrump and New Jersey Generals quarterback Doug Flutie at a 1985 press conference in Trump Tower \nIn September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the United States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to Trump's attempt to move to a fall schedule (when it would have competed with the NFL for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit.[85][86] \nTrump and his Plaza Hotel hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall.[68][87] In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.[88] \nFrom 1986 to 1988, Trump purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit,[44] leading some observers to think he was engaged in greenmail.[89] The New York Times found that Trump initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but \"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously\".[44] \nIn 1988, Trump purchased the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle, financing the purchase with $380 million (equivalent to $979 million in 2023)[32] in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airline Trump Shuttle and operated it until 1992.[90] Trump defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks.[91] \nTrump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame \nIn 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20 percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20–50 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups.[40][92] The increased costs were used to get state approval for increasing the rents of Trump's rent-stabilized units.[40] \nFrom 1996 to 2015, Trump owned all or part of the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA.[93][94] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002.[95][96] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[97] NBC and Univision dropped the pageants in June 2015.[98] \nTrump University\nIn 2004, Trump co-founded Trump University, a company that sold real estate seminars for up to $35,000.[99] After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of \"university\" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.[100] \nIn 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers.[101] Additionally, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.[102][103][104] Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, Trump agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases.[105] \nFoundation\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988.[106][107] From 1987 to 2006, Trump gave his foundation $5.4 million which had been spent by the end of 2006. After donating a total of $65,000 in 2007–2008, he stopped donating any personal funds to the charity,[108] which received millions from other donors, including $5 million from Vince McMahon.[109] The foundation gave to health- and sports-related charities, conservative groups,[110] and charities that held events at Trump properties.[108] \nIn 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[111] Also in 2016, the New York attorney general determined the foundation to be in violation of state law, for soliciting donations without submitting to required annual external audits, and ordered it to cease its fundraising activities in New York immediately.[112] Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.[113] \nIn June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.[114] In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities.[115] In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.[116][117] \nLegal affairs and bankruptcies\nRoy Cohn was Trump's fixer, lawyer, and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.[118] According to Trump, Cohn sometimes waived fees due to their friendship.[118] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the U.S. government for $100 million (equivalent to $686 million in 2023)[32] over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case went forward, ultimately resulting in a settlement.[119] In 1975, an agreement was struck requiring Trump's properties to furnish the New York Urban League with a list of all apartment vacancies, every week for two years, among other things.[120] Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.[121] \nAccording to a review of state and federal court files conducted by USA Today in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.[122] While Trump has not filed for personal bankruptcy, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009.[123] They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced Trump's shares in the properties.[123] \nDuring the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion.[124] After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks, with the exception of Deutsche Bank, declined to lend to him.[125] After the January 6 Capitol attack, the bank decided not to do business with Trump or his company in the future.[126] \nBooks\nUsing ghostwriters, Trump has produced 19 books under his name.[127] His first book, The Art of the Deal (1987), was a New York Times Best Seller. While Trump was credited as co-author, the entire book was written by Tony Schwartz. According to The New Yorker, the book made Trump famous as an \"emblem of the successful tycoon\".[128] \nFilm and television\nTrump made cameo appearances in many films and television shows from 1985 to 2001.[129] \nStarting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show.[130] He also had his own short-form talk radio program called Trumped! (one to two minutes on weekdays) from 2004 to 2008.[131][132] From 2011 until 2015, he was a weekly unpaid guest commentator on Fox & Friends.[133][134] \nFrom 2004 to 2015, Trump was co-producer and host of reality shows The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice. Trump played a flattering, highly fictionalized version of himself as a superrich and successful chief executive who eliminated contestants with the catchphrase \"You're fired.\" The shows remade his image for millions of viewers nationwide.[135][136] With the related licensing agreements, they earned him more than $400 million which he invested in largely unprofitable businesses.[137] \nIn February 2021, Trump, who had been a member of SAG-AFTRA since 1989, resigned to avoid a disciplinary hearing regarding the January 6 attack.[138] Two days later, the union permanently barred him from readmission.[139] \nPolitical career\nTrump and President Bill Clinton, June 2000 \nTrump registered as a Republican in 1987;[140] a member of the Independence Party, the New York state affiliate of the Reform Party, in 1999;[141] a Democrat in 2001; a Republican in 2009; unaffiliated in 2011; and a Republican in 2012.[140] \nIn 1987, Trump placed full-page advertisements in three major newspapers,[142] expressing his views on foreign policy and how to eliminate the federal budget deficit.[143] In 1988, he approached Lee Atwater, asking to be put into consideration to be Republican nominee George H. W. Bush's running mate. Bush found the request \"strange and unbelievable\".[144] \nPresidential campaigns (2000–2016)\nTrump ran in the California and Michigan primaries for nomination as the Reform Party candidate for the 2000 presidential election but withdrew from the race in February 2000.[145][146][147] \nTrump speaking at CPAC 2011 \nIn 2011, Trump speculated about running against President Barack Obama in the 2012 election, making his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011 and giving speeches in early primary states.[148][149] In May 2011, he announced he would not run.[148] Trump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time.[150] \n2016 presidential campaign\nTrump's fame and provocative statements earned him an unprecedented amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[151] He adopted the phrase \"truthful hyperbole\", coined by his ghostwriter Tony Schwartz, to describe his public speaking style.[128][152] His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive,[153] and a record number were false.[154][155][156] Trump said he disdained political correctness and frequently made claims of media bias.[157][158] \nTrump campaigning in Arizona, March 2016 \nTrump announced his candidacy in June 2015.[159][160] His campaign was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls.[161] He became the front-runner in March 2016[162] and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee in May.[163] \nHillary Clinton led Trump in national polling averages throughout the campaign, but, in early July, her lead narrowed.[164][165] In mid-July Trump selected Indiana governor Mike Pence as his running mate,[166] and the two were officially nominated at the 2016 Republican National Convention.[167] Trump and Clinton faced off in three presidential debates in September and October 2016. Trump twice refused to say whether he would accept the result of the election.[168] \nCampaign rhetoric and political positions\nTrump's political positions and rhetoric were right-wing populist.[169][170][171] Politico described them as \"eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory\", quoting a health-care policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute as saying that his political positions were a \"random assortment of whatever plays publicly\".[172] NBC News counted \"141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues\" during his campaign.[173] \nTrump described NATO as \"obsolete\"[174][175] and espoused views that were described as non-interventionist and protectionist.[176] His campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.–Mexico border. Other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations, modernizing services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. He advocated increasing military spending and extreme vetting or banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries.[177] \nTrump helped bring far-right fringe ideas and organizations into the mainstream.[178] In August 2016, Trump hired Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News—described by Bannon as \"the platform for the alt-right\"—as his campaign CEO.[179] The alt-right movement coalesced around and supported Trump's candidacy, due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[180][181][182] \nFinancial disclosures\nTrump's FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $315 million.[34][183] Trump did not release his tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office.[184][185] He said his tax returns were being audited, and that his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[186] After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to the Manhattan district attorney for a criminal investigation, including two appeals by Trump to the U.S. Supreme Court, in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury.[187][188] \nIn October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that Trump had declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years.[189] \nElection to the presidency\nOn November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Clinton, though, after elector defections on both sides, the official count was ultimately 304 to 227.[190] Trump, the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote, received nearly 2.9 million fewer votes than Clinton.[191] He also was the only president who neither served in the military nor held any government office prior to becoming president.[192] Trump's victory was a political upset.[193] Polls had consistently shown Clinton with a nationwide—though diminishing—lead, as well as an advantage in most of the competitive states.[194] \nTrump won 30 states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, states which had been considered a blue wall of Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Clinton won 20 states and the District of Columbia. Trump's victory marked the return of an undivided Republican government—a Republican White House combined with Republican control of both chambers of Congress.[195] \nWomen's March in Washington on January 21, 2017 \nTrump's election victory sparked protests in major U.S. cities.[196][197] On the day after Trump's inauguration, an estimated 2.6 million people worldwide, including an estimated half million in Washington, D.C., protested against Trump in the Women's Marches.[198] \nPresidency (2017–2021)\nEarly actions\nTrump is sworn in as president by Chief Justice John Roberts \nTrump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders, which authorized: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City policy, advancement of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcement of border security, and a planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[199] \nTrump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner became his assistant and senior advisor, respectively.[200][201] \nConflicts of interest\nTrump's presidency was marked by significant public concern about conflict of interest stemming from his diverse business ventures. In the lead up to his inauguration, Trump promised to remove himself from the day-to-day operations of his businesses.[202] Before being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., and Chief Finance Officer Allen Weisselberg and claimed they would not communicate with him regarding his interests. However, critics noted that this would not prevent him from having input into his businesses and knowing how to benefit himself, and Trump continued to receive quarterly updates on his businesses.[203][204][205] Unlike every other president in the last 40 years, Trump did not put his business interests in a blind trust or equivalent arrangement \"to cleanly sever himself from his business interests\".[206] Trump continued to profit from his businesses and to know how his administration's policies affected his businesses.[205][207] \nAs his presidency progressed, he failed to take steps or show interest in further distancing himself from his business interests resulting in numerous potential conflicts.[208] Ethics experts found Trump's plan to address conflicts of interest between his position as president and his private business interests to be entirely inadequate.[206][209] Though he said he would eschew \"new foreign deals\", the Trump Organization pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic.[205][207] In January 2024, Democratic members of the US House Committee on Oversight and Accountability released a report that detailed over $7.8 million in payments from foreign governments to Trump-owned businesses.[210][211] \nTrump was sued for violating the Domestic and Foreign Emoluments Clauses of the U.S. Constitution, marking the first time that the clauses had been substantively litigated.[212] One case was dismissed in lower court.[213] Two were dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court as moot after the end of Trump's term.[214] \nDuring Trump's term in office, he visited a Trump Organization property on 428 days, one visit for every 3.4 days of his presidency.[215] In September 2020, The Washington Post reported that Trump's properties had charged the government over $1.1 million since the beginning of his presidency. Government officials and Secret Service employees were charged as much as $650 per night to stay at Trump's properties.[216] \nDomestic policy\nEconomy\nTrump took office at the height of the longest economic expansion in American history,[217] which began in 2009 and continued until February 2020, when the COVID-19 recession began.[218] \nIn December 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 passed by Congress without Democratic votes.[relevant?] It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals, with business tax cuts to be permanent and individual tax cuts set to expire after 2025,[importance?] and set the penalty associated with the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate to $0.[219][220] The Trump administration claimed that the act would not decrease government revenue, but 2018 revenues were 7.6 percent lower than projected.[221] \nDespite a campaign promise to eliminate the national debt in eight years, Trump approved large increases in government spending and the 2017 tax cut. As a result, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50 percent, to nearly $1 trillion in 2019.[222] Under Trump, the U.S. national debt increased by 39 percent, reaching $27.75 trillion by the end of his term, and the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio hit a post-World War II high.[223] Trump also failed to deliver the $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan on which he had campaigned.[224] \nTrump is the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce than when he took office, by 3 million people.[217][225] \nClimate change, environment, and energy\nTrump rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[226][227][228][229] He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40 percent and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change.[230] He withdrew from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation to not ratify it.[231] \nTrump aimed to boost the production and exports of fossil fuels.[232][233] Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline.[234][235] Trump rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbed greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing drilling in the Arctic Refuge.[236] \nDeregulation\nIn 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13771, which directed that, for every new regulation, federal agencies \"identify\" two existing regulations for elimination, though it did not require elimination.[237] He dismantled many federal regulations on health,[238][239] labor,[240][239] and the environment,[241][239] among others, including a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns.[242] During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations,[243] often \"after requests by the regulated industries\".[244] The Institute for Policy Integrity found that 78 percent of Trump's proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation.[245] \nHealth care\nDuring his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.[246] In office, he scaled back the Act's implementation through executive orders.[247][248] Trump expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\"; his administration halved the enrollment period and drastically reduced funding for enrollment promotion.[249][250] In June 2018, the Trump administration joined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Court that the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the Act unconstitutional.[251][252] Their pleading would have eliminated health insurance coverage for up to 23 million Americans, but was unsuccessful.[251] During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs, but in January 2020, he expressed willingness to consider cuts to them.[253] \nIn response to the opioid epidemic, Trump signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy. U.S. opioid overdose deaths declined slightly in 2018 but surged to a record 50,052 in 2019.[254] \nTrump barred organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals from receiving federal funds.[255] He said he supported \"traditional marriage\" but considered the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage \"settled\".[256] His administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections against discrimination of LGBT people.[257] Trump's attempted rollback of anti-discrimination protections for transgender patients in August 2020 was halted by a federal judge after a Supreme Court ruling extended employees' civil rights protections to gender identity and sexual orientation.[258] \nTrump has said he is opposed to gun control, although his views have shifted over time.[259] After several mass shootings during his term, he said he would propose legislation related to guns, but he abandoned that effort in November 2019.[260] His administration took an anti-marijuana position, revoking Obama-era policies that provided protections for states that legalized marijuana.[261] \nTrump is a long-time advocate of capital punishment.[262][263] Under his administration, the federal government executed 13 prisoners, more than in the previous 56 years combined and after a 17-year moratorium.[264] In 2016, Trump said he supported the use of interrogation torture methods such as waterboarding[265][266] but later appeared to recant this due to the opposition of Defense Secretary James Mattis.[267] \nTrump and group of officials and advisors on the way from the White House to St. John's Church \nIn June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, federal law-enforcement officials controversially used less lethal weapons to remove a largely peaceful crowd of lawful protesters from Lafayette Square, outside the White House.[268][269] Trump then posed with a Bible for a photo-op at the nearby St. John's Episcopal Church,[268][270][271] with religious leaders condemning both the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself.[272] Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned Trump's proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters.[273] \nPardons and commutations\nTrump granted 237 requests for clemency, fewer than all presidents since 1900 with the exception of George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush.[274] Only 25 of them had been vetted by the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney; the others were granted to people with personal or political connections to him, his family, and his allies, or recommended by celebrities.[275][276] In his last full day in office, Trump granted 73 pardons and commuted 70 sentences.[277] Several Trump allies were not eligible for pardons under Justice Department rules, and in other cases the department had opposed clemency.[275] The pardons of three military service members convicted of or charged with violent crimes were opposed by military leaders.[278] \nImmigration\nTrump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter debate during the campaign. He promised to build a wall on the Mexico–U.S. border to restrict illegal movement and vowed that Mexico would pay for it.[279] He pledged to deport millions of illegal immigrants residing in the U.S.,[280] and criticized birthright citizenship for incentivizing \"anchor babies\".[281] As president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an \"invasion\" and conflated immigrants with the criminal gang MS-13.[282] \nTrump attempted to drastically escalate immigration enforcement, including implementing harsher immigration enforcement policies against asylum seekers from Central America than any modern U.S. president.[283][284] \nFrom 2018 onward, Trump deployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.–Mexico border[285] to stop most Central American migrants from seeking asylum. In 2020, his administration widened the public charge rule to further restrict immigrants who might use government benefits from getting permanent residency.[286] Trump reduced the number of refugees admitted to record lows. When Trump took office, the annual limit was 110,000; Trump set a limit of 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year and 15,000 in the 2021 fiscal year.[287][288] Additional restrictions implemented by the Trump administration caused significant bottlenecks in processing refugee applications, resulting in fewer refugees accepted than the allowed limits.[289] \nTravel ban\nFollowing the 2015 San Bernardino attack, Trump proposed to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the U.S. until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[290] He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a \"proven history of terrorism\".[291] \nOn January 27, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order took effect immediately and without warning, causing chaos at airports.[292][293] Protests began at airports the next day,[292][293] and legal challenges resulted in nationwide preliminary injunctions.[294] A March 6 revised order, which excluded Iraq and gave other exemptions, again was blocked by federal judges in three states.[295][296] In a decision in June 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a \"credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States\".[297] \nThe temporary order was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645 on September 24, 2017, which restricted travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further banned travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials.[298] After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4, 2017,[299] and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a ruling in June 2019.[300] \nFamily separation at the border\nThe Trump administration separated more than 5,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.–Mexico border, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017.[301][302] In April 2018, the Trump administration announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy whereby adults suspected of illegal entry were to be detained and criminally prosecuted while their children were taken away as unaccompanied alien minors.[303][304] The policy was unprecedented in previous administrations and sparked public outrage.[305][306] Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law, blaming Democrats, despite the separations being his administration's policy.[307][308][309] \nAlthough Trump originally argued that the separations could not be stopped by an executive order, he acceded to intense public objection and signed an executive order in June 2018, mandating that migrant families be detained together unless \"there is a concern\" of a risk to the child.[310][311] On June 26, 2018, Judge Dana Sabraw concluded that the Trump administration had \"no system in place to keep track of\" the separated children, nor any effective measures for family communication and reunification;[312] Sabraw ordered for the families to be reunited and family separations stopped except in limited circumstances.[313] After the order, the Trump administration separated more than a thousand migrant children from their families; the ACLU contended that the Trump administration had abused its discretion and asked Sabraw to more narrowly define the circumstances warranting separation.[302] \nTrump wall and government shutdown\nTrump examines border wall prototypes in Otay Mesa, California. \nOne of Trump's central campaign promises was to build a 1,000-mile (1,600 km) border wall to Mexico and have Mexico pay for it.[314] By the end of his term, the U.S. had built \"40 miles [64 km] of new primary wall and 33 miles [53 km] of secondary wall\" in locations where there had been no barriers and 365 miles (587 km) of primary or secondary border fencing replacing dilapidated or outdated barriers.[315] \nIn 2018, Trump refused to sign any appropriations bill from Congress unless it allocated $5.6 billion for the border wall,[316] resulting in the federal government partially shutting down for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.[317][318] Around 800,000 government employees were furloughed or worked without pay.[319] Trump and Congress ended the shutdown by approving temporary funding that provided delayed payments to government workers but no funds for the wall.[317] The shutdown resulted in an estimated permanent loss of $3 billion to the economy, according to the Congressional Budget Office.[320] About half of those polled blamed Trump for the shutdown, and Trump's approval ratings dropped.[321] \nTo prevent another imminent shutdown in February 2019, Congress passed and Trump signed a funding bill that included $1.375 billion for 55 miles (89 km) of bollard border fencing.[322] Trump also declared a national emergency on the southern border, intending to divert $6.1 billion of funds Congress had allocated to other purposes.[322] Trump vetoed a joint resolution to overturn the declaration, and the Senate voted against a veto override.[323] Legal challenges to the diversion of $2.5 billion originally meant for the Department of Defense's drug interdiction efforts[324][325] and $3.6 billion originally meant for military construction[326][327] were unsuccessful. \nForeign policy\nTrump with the other G7 leaders at the 45th summit in France, 2019 \nTrump described himself as a \"nationalist\"[328] and his foreign policy as \"America First\".[329] He praised and supported populist, neo-nationalist, and authoritarian governments.[330] Hallmarks of foreign relations during Trump's tenure included unpredictability, uncertainty, and inconsistency.[329][331] Tensions between the U.S. and its European allies were strained under Trump.[332] He criticized NATO allies and privately suggested on multiple occasions that the U.S. should withdraw from NATO.[333][334] \nTrade\nTrump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations,[335] imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,[336] and launched a trade war with China by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50 billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.[337] While Trump said that import tariffs are paid by China into the U.S. Treasury, they are paid by American companies that import goods from China.[338] Although he pledged during the campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.'s large trade deficits, the trade deficit skyrocketed under Trump.[339] Following a 2017–2018 renegotiation, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) became effective in July 2020 as the successor to NAFTA.[340] \nRussia\nVladimir Putin and Trump shaking hands at the G20 Osaka summit, June 2019 \nThe Trump administration weakened the toughest sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Russian entities after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.[341][342] Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing alleged Russian non-compliance,[343] and supported a potential return of Russia to the G7.[344] \nTrump repeatedly praised and rarely criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin[345][346] but opposed some actions of the Russian government.[347][348] After he met Putin at the Helsinki Summit in 2018, Trump drew bipartisan criticism for accepting Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies.[349][350][351] Trump did not discuss alleged Russian bounties offered to Taliban fighters for attacking American soldiers in Afghanistan with Putin, saying both that he doubted the intelligence and that he was not briefed on it.[352] \nChina\nTrump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G20 Buenos Aires summit, December 2018 \nTrump repeatedly accused China of taking unfair advantage of the U.S.[353] He launched a trade war against China that was widely characterized as a failure,[354][355][356] sanctioned Huawei for alleged ties to Iran,[357] significantly increased visa restrictions on Chinese students and scholars,[358] and classified China as a currency manipulator.[359] Trump also juxtaposed verbal attacks on China with praise of Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping,[360] which was attributed to trade war negotiations.[361] After initially praising China for its handling of COVID-19,[362] he began a campaign of criticism starting in March 2020.[363] \nTrump said he resisted punishing China for its human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region for fear of jeopardizing trade negotiations.[364] In July 2020, the Trump administration imposed sanctions and visa restrictions against senior Chinese officials, in response to expanded mass detention camps holding more than a million of the country's Uyghur minority.[365] \nNorth Korea\nTrump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Singapore summit, June 2018 \nIn 2017, when North Korea's nuclear weapons were increasingly seen as a serious threat,[366] Trump escalated his rhetoric, warning that North Korean aggression would be met with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\".[367][368] In 2017, Trump declared that he wanted North Korea's \"complete denuclearization\", and engaged in name-calling with leader Kim Jong Un.[367][369] After this period of tension, Trump and Kim exchanged at least 27 letters in which the two men described a warm personal friendship.[370][371] In March 2019, Trump lifted some U.S. sanctions against North Korea against the advice of his Treasury Department.[372] \nTrump, the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader, met Kim three times: in Singapore in 2018, in Hanoi in 2019, and in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in 2019.[373] However, no denuclearization agreement was reached,[374] and talks in October 2019 broke down after one day.[375] While conducting no nuclear tests since 2017, North Korea continued to build up its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.[376][377] \nAfghanistan\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meeting with Taliban delegation in Qatar in September 2020 \nU.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 in January 2017 to 14,000 a year later,[378] reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[379] In February 2020, the Trump administration signed a peace agreement with the Taliban, which called for the withdrawal of foreign troops in 14 months \"contingent on a guarantee from the Taliban that Afghan soil will not be used by terrorists with aims to attack the United States or its allies\" and for the U.S. to seek the release of 5,000 Taliban imprisoned by the Afghan government.[380][381][382] By the end of Trump's term, 5,000 Taliban had been released, and, despite the Taliban continuing attacks on Afghan forces and integrating Al-Qaeda members into its leadership, U.S. troops had been reduced to 2,500.[382] \nIsrael\nTrump supported many of the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[383] Under Trump, the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel[384] and Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights,[385] leading to international condemnation including from the UN General Assembly, European Union, and Arab League.[386][387] In 2020, the White House hosted the signing of agreements, named Abraham Accords, between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalize their foreign relations.[388] \nSaudi Arabia\nTrump, King Salman of Saudi Arabia, and Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at the 2017 Riyadh summit in Saudi Arabia \nTrump actively supported the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and in 2017 signed a $110 billion agreement to sell arms to Saudi Arabia.[389] In 2018, the U.S. provided limited intelligence and logistical support for the intervention.[390][391] Following the 2019 attack on Saudi oil facilities, which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed on Iran, Trump approved the deployment of 3,000 additional U.S. troops, including fighter squadrons, two Patriot batteries, and a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.[392] \nSyria\nTrump and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at the White House in May 2017 \nTrump ordered missile strikes in April 2017 and April 2018 against the Assad regime in Syria, in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun and Douma chemical attacks, respectively.[393][394] In December 2018, Trump declared \"we have won against ISIS\", contradicting Department of Defense assessments, and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria.[395][396] The next day, Mattis resigned in protest, calling Trump's decision an abandonment of the U.S.'s Kurdish allies who played a key role in fighting ISIS.[397] In October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, U.S. troops in northern Syria were withdrawn from the area and Turkey invaded northern Syria, attacking and displacing American-allied Kurds.[398] Later that month, the U.S. House of Representatives, in a rare bipartisan vote of 354–60, condemned Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, for \"abandoning U.S. allies, undermining the struggle against ISIS, and spurring a humanitarian catastrophe\".[399][400] \nIran\nIn May 2018, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the 2015 agreement that lifted most economic sanctions against Iran in return for restrictions on Iran's nuclear program.[401][402] In August 2020, the Trump administration unsuccessfully attempted to use a section of the nuclear deal to have the UN reimpose sanctions against Iran.[403] Analysts determined that, after the U.S. withdrawal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon.[404] \nOn January 1, 2020, Trump ordered a U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who had planned nearly every significant Iranian and Iranian-backed operation over the preceding two decades.[405][406] One week later, Iran retaliated with ballistic missile strikes against two U.S. airbases in Iraq. Dozens of soldiers sustained traumatic brain injuries. Trump downplayed their injuries, and they were initially denied Purple Hearts and the benefits accorded to its recipients.[407][404] \nPersonnel\nThe Trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[408] As of early July 2018, 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left[409] and 141 staffers had left in the previous year.[410] Both figures set a record for recent presidents—more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[411] Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (after just 25 days), and Press Secretary Sean Spicer.[411] Close personal aides to Trump including Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee, and Keith Schiller quit or were forced out.[412] Some later returned in different posts.[413] Trump publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy.[414] \nTrump had four White House chiefs of staff, marginalizing or pushing out several.[415] Reince Priebus was replaced after seven months by retired Marine general John F. Kelly.[416] Kelly resigned in December 2018 after a tumultuous tenure in which his influence waned, and Trump subsequently disparaged him.[417] Kelly was succeeded by Mick Mulvaney as acting chief of staff; he was replaced in March 2020 by Mark Meadows.[415] \nOn May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI director James Comey. While initially attributing this action to Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails, Trump said a few days later that he was concerned with Comey's role in the ongoing Trump-Russia investigations, and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[418] At a private conversation in February, Trump said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation into Flynn.[419] In March and April, Trump asked Comey to \"lift the cloud impairing his ability to act\" by saying publicly that the FBI was not investigating him.[419][420] \nTrump lost three of his 15 original cabinet members within his first year.[421] Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft.[421][412] Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in 2018 and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke in January 2019 amid multiple investigations into their conduct.[422][423] \nTrump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.[424] By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61 percent) and Trump had no nominee for 264 (37 percent).[425] \nJudiciary\nTrump and his third Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett \nTrump appointed 226 Article III judges, including 54 to the courts of appeals and three to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.[426] His Supreme Court nominees were noted as having politically shifted the Court to the right.[427][428][429] In the 2016 campaign, he pledged that Roe v. Wade would be overturned \"automatically\" if he were elected and provided the opportunity to appoint two or three anti-abortion justices. He later took credit when Roe was overturned in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization; all three of his Supreme Court nominees voted with the majority.[430][431][432] \nTrump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary's constitutional authority. His attacks on the courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of his statements on the judicial independence and public confidence in the judiciary.[433][434][435] \nCOVID-19 pandemic\nInitial response\nThe first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was reported on January 20, 2020.[436] The outbreak was officially declared a public health emergency by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar on January 31, 2020.[437] Trump initially ignored persistent public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and Secretary Azar.[438][439] Throughout January and February he focused on economic and political considerations of the outbreak.[440] In February 2020 Trump publicly asserted that the outbreak in the U.S. was less deadly than influenza, was \"very much under control\", and would soon be over.[441] On March 19, 2020, Trump privately told Bob Woodward that he was deliberately \"playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic\".[442][443] \nBy mid-March, most global financial markets had severely contracted in response to the pandemic.[444] On March 6, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies.[445] On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized COVID-19 as a pandemic,[446] and Trump announced partial travel restrictions for most of Europe, effective March 13.[447] That same day, he gave his first serious assessment of the virus in a nationwide Oval Office address, calling the outbreak \"horrible\" but \"a temporary moment\" and saying there was no financial crisis.[448] On March 13, he declared a national emergency, freeing up federal resources.[449] Trump claimed that \"anybody that wants a test can get a test\", despite test availability being severely limited.[450] \nOn April 22, Trump signed an executive order restricting some forms of immigration.[451] In late spring and early summer, with infections and deaths continuing to rise, he adopted a strategy of blaming the states rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the pandemic were overly optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership.[452] \nWhite House Coronavirus Task Force\nTrump conducts a COVID-19 press briefing with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force on March 15, 2020. \nTrump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January 29, 2020.[453] Beginning in mid-March, Trump held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials,[454] sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments.[455] Trump was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, and denounced the press.[454][456] On March 16, he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur.[457] His repeated use of \"Chinese virus\" and \"China virus\" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from health experts.[458][459][460] \nBy early April, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration's response, Trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, Democratic state governors, the previous administration, China, and the WHO.[461] The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April, after a briefing at which Trump suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID-19;[462] the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals.[463][464] \nIn early May, Trump proposed the phase-out of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, Trump said the task force would \"indefinitely\" continue.[465] By the end of May, the coronavirus task force's meetings were sharply reduced.[466] \nWorld Health Organization\nPrior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the WHO and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid.[467] His administration's proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half.[467] In May and April, Trump accused the WHO of \"severely mismanaging\" COVID-19, alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government's concealment of the pandemic's origins,[467][468][469] and announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization.[467] These were seen as attempts to distract from his own mishandling of the pandemic.[467][470][471] In July 2020, Trump announced the formal withdrawal of the U.S. from the WHO, effective July 2021.[468][469] The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as \"short-sighted\", \"senseless\", and \"dangerous\".[468][469] \nPressure to abandon pandemic mitigation measures\nIn April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized anti-lockdown protests against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic;[472][473] Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter,[474] even though the targeted states did not meet the Trump administration's guidelines for reopening.[475] In April 2020, he first supported, then later criticized, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's plan to reopen some nonessential businesses.[476] Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions to reverse the damage to the country's economy.[477] Trump often refused to mask at public events, contrary to his administration's April 2020 guidance to wear masks in public[478] and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing spread of the virus.[479] By June, Trump had said masks were a \"double-edged sword\"; ridiculed Biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that mask-wearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally.[479] Trump's contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.[478][479] \nIn June and July, Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases \"makes us look bad\".[480][481] The CDC guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be \"quickly identified and tested\" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus.[482][483] In August 2020 the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, \"do not necessarily need a test\". The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under Trump administration pressure, against the wishes of CDC scientists.[484][485] The day after this political interference was reported, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation.[485] \nDespite record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from mid-June onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results, Trump largely continued to downplay the pandemic, including his false claim in early July 2020 that 99 percent of COVID-19 cases are \"totally harmless\".[486][487] He began insisting that all states should resume in-person education in the fall despite a July spike in reported cases.[488] \nPolitical pressure on health agencies\nTrump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,[484] such as approving unproven treatments[489][490] or speeding up vaccine approvals.[490] Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined Trump's claims that the pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication.[491][492] Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a \"deep state\" opposing him and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically.[493] \nOutbreak at the White House\nTrump boards Marine One for COVID-19 treatment on October 2, 2020 \nOn October 2, 2020, Trump tweeted that he had tested positive for COVID-19, part of a White House outbreak.[494] Later that day Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, reportedly due to fever and labored breathing. He was treated with antiviral and experimental antibody drugs and a steroid. He returned to the White House on October 5, still infectious and unwell.[495][496] During and after his treatment he continued to downplay the virus.[495] In 2021, it was revealed that his condition had been far more serious; he had dangerously low blood oxygen levels, a high fever, and lung infiltrates, indicating a severe case.[496] \nEffects on the 2020 presidential campaign\nBy July 2020, Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had become a major issue in the presidential election.[497] Biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue.[498] Polls suggested voters blamed Trump for his pandemic response[497] and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with an Ipsos/ABC News poll indicating 65 percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response.[499] In the final months of the campaign, Trump repeatedly said that the U.S. was \"rounding the turn\" in managing the pandemic, despite increasing cases and deaths.[500] A few days before the November 3 election, the U.S. reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time.[501] \nInvestigations\nAfter he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation.[502] There were ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.[503] \nIn April 2019, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, and his accounting firm, Mazars USA. Trump sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chair Elijah Cummings to prevent the disclosures.[504] In May, DC District Court judge Amit Mehta ruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena,[505] and judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District Court of New York ruled that the banks must also comply.[506][507] Trump's attorneys appealed.[508] In September 2022, the committee and Trump agreed to a settlement about Mazars, and the accounting firm began turning over documents.[509] \nRussian election interference\nIn January 2017, American intelligence agencies—the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence—jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[510][511] In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress, \"[T]he FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.\"[512] \nMany suspicious[513] links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spies were discovered and the relationships between Russians and \"team Trump\", including Manafort, Flynn, and Stone, were widely reported by the press.[514][515][516][517] Members of Trump's campaign and his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the election.[518][519] On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that were imposed that same day; Flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled Pence.[520] Trump told Kislyak and Sergei Lavrov in May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections.[521] \nTrump and his allies promoted a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 election—which was also promoted by Russia to frame Ukraine.[522] \nFBI Crossfire Hurricane and 2017 counterintelligence investigations\nIn July 2016, the FBI launched an investigation, codenamed Crossfire Hurricane, into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.[523] After Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's personal and business dealings with Russia.[524] Crossfire Hurricane was transferred to the Mueller investigation,[525] but Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein ended the investigation into Trump's direct ties to Russia while giving the bureau the false impression that the Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation would pursue the matter.[526][527] \nMueller investigation\nIn May 2017, Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Mueller special counsel for the Department of Justice (DOJ), ordering him to \"examine 'any links and/or coordination between the Russian government' and the Trump campaign\". He privately told Mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters \"in connection with Russia's 2016 election interference\".[526] The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice[528] and the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.[529] Trump sought to fire Mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.[530] \nIn March 2019, Mueller gave his final report to Attorney General William Barr,[531] which Barr purported to summarize in a letter to Congress. A federal court, and Mueller himself, said Barr mischaracterized the investigation's conclusions and, in so doing, confused the public.[532][533][534] Trump repeatedly claimed that the investigation exonerated him; the Mueller report expressly stated that it did not.[535] \nA redacted version of the report, publicly released in April 2019, found that Russia interfered in 2016 to favor Trump.[536] Despite \"numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", the report found that the prevailing evidence \"did not establish\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference.[537][538] The report revealed sweeping Russian interference[538] and detailed how Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged it, believing it would benefit them electorally.[539][540][541][542] \nThe report also detailed multiple acts of potential obstruction of justice by Trump but \"did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President's conduct\".[543][544] Investigators decided they could not \"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\" as an Office of Legal Counsel opinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted,[545] and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court.[546] The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \"may apply the obstruction laws\".[545] The House of Representatives subsequently launched an impeachment inquiry following the Trump–Ukraine scandal, but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation.[547][548] \nSeveral Trump associates pleaded guilty or were convicted in connection with Mueller's investigation and related cases, including Manafort[549] and Flynn.[550][551] Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump.[552] In February 2020, Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison for lying to Congress and witness tampering. The sentencing judge said Stone \"was prosecuted for covering up for the president\".[553] \nFirst impeachment\nMembers of House of Representatives vote on two articles of impeachment (H.Res. 755), December 18, 2019 \nIn August 2019, a whistleblower filed a complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community about a July 25 phone call between Trump and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which Trump had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his son Hunter.[554] The whistleblower said that the White House had attempted to cover up the incident and that the call was part of a wider campaign by the Trump administration and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani that may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip.[555] \nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24.[556] Trump then confirmed that he withheld military aid from Ukraine, offering contradictory reasons for the decision.[557][558] On September 25, the Trump administration released a memorandum of the phone call which confirmed that, after Zelenskyy mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked him to discuss investigating Biden and his son with Giuliani and Barr.[554][559] The testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further Trump's personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election.[560] In October, William B. Taylor Jr., the chargé d'affaires for Ukraine, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by Trump and led by Giuliani. According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelenskyy into making a public commitment to investigate the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[561] He said it was made clear that until Zelenskyy made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelenskyy to the White House.[562] \nOn December 13, the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment: one for abuse of power and one for obstruction of Congress.[563] After debate, the House of Representatives impeached Trump on both articles on December 18.[564] \nImpeachment trial in the Senate\nTrump displaying the headline \"Trump acquitted\" \nDuring the trial in January 2020, the House impeachment managers cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress and asserted that Trump's actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the impeachment process.[565] \nTrump's lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges but said Trump had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress.[566] They argued that the impeachment was \"constitutionally and legally invalid\" because Trump was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense.[566] \nOn January 31, the Senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents.[567] The impeachment trial was the first in U.S. history without witness testimony.[568] \nTrump was acquitted of both charges by the Republican majority. Senator Mitt Romney was the only Republican who voted to convict Trump on one charge, the abuse of power.[569] Following his acquittal, Trump fired impeachment witnesses and other political appointees and career officials he deemed insufficiently loyal.[570] \n2020 presidential campaign\nBreaking with precedent, Trump filed to run for a second term within a few hours of assuming the presidency.[571] He held his first reelection rally less than a month after taking office[572] and officially became the Republican nominee in August 2020.[573] \nIn his first two years in office, Trump's reelection committee reported raising $67.5 million and began 2019 with $19.3 million in cash.[574] By July 2020, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party had raised $1.1 billion and spent $800 million, losing their cash advantage over Biden.[575] The cash shortage forced the campaign to scale back advertising spending.[576] \nTrump campaign advertisements focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Biden won.[577] Trump repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions[578][579] and shifted to appeals to racism.[580] \n2020 presidential election\nStarting in the spring of 2020, Trump began to sow doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.[581][582] When, in August, the House of Representatives voted for a $25 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, Trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.[583] He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results if he lost and commit to a peaceful transition of power.[584][585] \nBiden won the election on November 3, receiving 81.3 million votes (51.3 percent) to Trump's 74.2 million (46.8 percent)[586][587] and 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232.[588] \nFalse claims of voting fraud, attempt to prevent presidential transition\nAt 2 a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, Trump declared victory.[589] After Biden was projected the winner days later, Trump stated that \"this election is far from over\" and baselessly alleged election fraud.[590] Trump and his allies filed many legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both the state and federal courts, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself, finding no factual or legal basis.[591][592] Trump's allegations were also refuted by state election officials.[593] After Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Chris Krebs contradicted Trump's fraud allegations, Trump dismissed him on November 17.[594] On December 11, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case from the Texas attorney general that asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by Biden.[595] \nTrump withdrew from public activities in the weeks following the election.[596] He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in Biden's presidential transition.[597][598] After three weeks, the administrator of the General Services Administration declared Biden the \"apparent winner\" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team.[599] Trump still did not formally concede while claiming he recommended the GSA begin transition protocols.[600][601] \nThe Electoral College formalized Biden's victory on December 14.[588] From November to January, Trump repeatedly sought help to overturn the results, personally pressuring Republican local and state office-holders,[602] Republican state and federal legislators,[603] the Justice Department,[604] and Vice President Pence,[605] urging various actions such as replacing presidential electors, or a request for Georgia officials to \"find\" votes and announce a \"recalculated\" result.[603] On February 10, 2021, Georgia prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Trump's efforts to subvert the election in Georgia.[606] \nTrump did not attend Biden's inauguration.[607] \nConcern about a possible coup attempt or military action\nIn December 2020, Newsweek reported the Pentagon was on red alert, and ranking officers had discussed what to do if Trump declared martial law. The Pentagon responded with quotes from defense leaders that the military has no role in the outcome of elections.[608] \nWhen Trump moved supporters into positions of power at the Pentagon after the November 2020 election, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and CIA director Gina Haspel became concerned about the threat of a possible coup attempt or military action against China or Iran.[609][610] Milley insisted that he should be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons, and he instructed Haspel and NSA director Paul Nakasone to monitor developments closely.[611][612] \nJanuary 6 Capitol attack\nOn January 6, 2021, while congressional certification of the presidential election results was taking place in the U.S. Capitol, Trump held a noon rally at the Ellipse, Washington, D.C.. He called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to \"take back our country\" by marching to the Capitol to \"fight like hell\".[613][614] Many supporters did, joining a crowd already there. The mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.[615] During the violence, Trump posted messages on Twitter without asking the rioters to disperse. At 6 p.m., Trump tweeted that the rioters should \"go home with love & in peace\", calling them \"great patriots\" and repeating that the election was stolen.[616] After the mob was removed, Congress reconvened and confirmed Biden's win in the early hours of the following morning.[617] According to the Department of Justice, more than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died.[618][619] \nIn March 2023, Trump collaborated with incarcerated rioters on a song to benefit the prisoners, and, in June, he said that, if elected, he would pardon many of them.[620] \nSecond impeachment\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi signing the second impeachment of Trump \nOn January 11, 2021, an article of impeachment charging Trump with incitement of insurrection against the U.S. government was introduced to the House.[621] The House voted 232–197 to impeach Trump on January 13, making him the first U.S. president to be impeached twice.[622] Ten Republicans voted for the impeachment—the most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party.[623] \nOn February 13, following a five-day Senate trial, Trump was acquitted when the Senate vote fell ten votes short of the two-thirds majority required to convict; seven Republicans joined every Democrat in voting to convict, the most bipartisan support in any Senate impeachment trial of a president or former president.[624][625] Most Republicans voted to acquit Trump, although some held him responsible but felt the Senate did not have jurisdiction over former presidents (Trump had left office on January 20; the Senate voted 56–44 that the trial was constitutional).[626] \nPost-presidency (2021–present)\nAt the end of his term, Trump went to live at his Mar-a-Lago club and established an office as provided for by the Former Presidents Act.[59][627][628] Trump is entitled to live there legally as a club employee.[629][630] \nTrump's false claims concerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the \"big lie\" in the press and by his critics. In May 2021, Trump and his supporters attempted to co-opt the term, using it to refer to the election itself.[631][632] The Republican Party used Trump's false election narrative to justify the imposition of new voting restrictions in its favor.[632][633] As late as July 2022, Trump was still pressuring state legislators to overturn the 2020 election.[634] \nUnlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; he has been described as a modern party boss. He continued fundraising, raising more than twice as much as the Republican Party itself, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on how elections are run and on ousting election officials who had resisted his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. In the 2022 midterm elections he endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices, most of whom supported his false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.[635][636][637] \nBusiness activities\nIn February 2021, Trump registered a new company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), for providing \"social networking services\" to U.S. customers.[638][639] In March 2024, TMTG merged with special-purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition and became a public company.[640] In February 2022, TMTG launched Truth Social, a social media platform.[641] As of March 2023, Trump Media, which had taken $8 million from Russia-connected entities, was being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible money laundering.[642][643] \nInvestigations, criminal indictments and convictions, civil lawsuits\nTrump is the only U.S. president or former president to be convicted of a crime and the first major-party candidate to run for president after a felony conviction.[644] He faces numerous criminal charges and civil cases.[645][646] \nFBI investigations\nClassified intelligence material found during search of Mar-a-Lago \nWhen Trump left the White House in January 2021, he took government materials with him to Mar-a-Lago. By May 2021, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) realized that important documents had not been turned over to them and asked his office to locate them. In January 2022, they retrieved 15 boxes of White House records from Mar-a-Lago. NARA later informed the Department of Justice that some of the retrieved documents were classified material.[647] The Justice Department began an investigation[648] and sent Trump a subpoena for additional material.[647] Justice Department officials visited Mar-a-Lago and received some classified documents from Trump's lawyers,[647] one of whom signed a statement affirming that all material marked as classified had been returned.[649] \nOn August 8, 2022, FBI agents searched Mar-a-Lago to recover government documents and material Trump had taken with him when he left office in violation of the Presidential Records Act,[650][651] reportedly including some related to nuclear weapons.[652] The search warrant indicates an investigation of potential violations of the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice laws.[653] The items taken in the search included 11 sets of classified documents, four of them tagged as \"top secret\" and one as \"top secret/SCI\", the highest level of classification.[650][651] \nOn November 18, 2022, U.S. attorney general Merrick Garland appointed federal prosecutor Jack Smith as a special counsel to oversee the federal criminal investigations into Trump retaining government property at Mar-a-Lago and examining Trump's role in the events leading up to the Capitol attack.[654][655] \nCriminal referral by the House January 6 Committee\nOn December 19, 2022, the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack recommended criminal charges against Trump for obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and inciting or assisting an insurrection.[656] \nFederal and state criminal indictments\nIn June 2023, following a special counsel investigation, a federal grand jury in Miami indicted Trump on 31 counts of \"willfully retaining national defense information\" under the Espionage Act, one count of making false statements, and one count each of conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding government documents, corruptly concealing records, concealing a document in a federal investigation and scheming to conceal their efforts.[657] He pleaded not guilty.[658] A superseding indictment the following month added three charges.[659] The judge assigned to the case, Aileen Cannon, was appointed to the bench by Trump and had previously issued rulings favorable to him in a past civil case, some of which were overturned by an appellate court.[660] She moved slowly on the case, indefinitely postponed the trial in May 2024, and dismissed it on July 15, ruling that the special counsel's appointment was unconstitutional.[661] On August 26, Special Counsel Smith appealed the dismissal.[662] \nOn August 1, 2023, a Washington, D.C., federal grand jury indicted Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. He was charged with conspiring to defraud the U.S., obstruct the certification of the Electoral College vote, and deprive voters of the civil right to have their votes counted, and obstructing an official proceeding.[663] Trump pleaded not guilty.[664] \nIn August 2023, a Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury indicted Trump on 13 charges, including racketeering, for his efforts to subvert the election outcome in Georgia; multiple Trump campaign officials were also indicted.[665][666] Trump surrendered, was processed at Fulton County Jail, and was released on bail pending trial.[667] He pleaded not guilty.[668] On March 13, 2024, the judge dismissed three of the 13 charges against Trump.[669] \nIn July 2021, New York prosecutors charged the Trump Organization with a tax-fraud scheme stretching over 15 years.[670] In January 2023, the organization's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, was sentenced to five months in jail and five years of probation for tax fraud after a plea deal.[671] In December 2022, following a jury trial, the Trump Organization was convicted on all counts of criminal tax fraud, conspiracy, and falsifying business records in connection with the scheme.[672][673] In January 2023, the organization was fined the maximum $1.6 million.[673] Trump was not personally charged in that case.[673] \nCriminal conviction in the 2016 campaign fraud case\nDuring the 2016 presidential election campaign, American Media, Inc. (AMI), publisher of the National Enquirer,[674] and a company set up by Cohen paid Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels for keeping silent about their alleged affairs with Trump between 2006 and 2007.[675] Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged both payments at Trump's direction to influence the presidential election.[676] Trump denied the affairs and said he was not aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, but he reimbursed him in 2017.[677][678] Federal prosecutors asserted that Trump had been involved in discussions regarding non-disclosure payments as early as 2014.[679] Court documents showed that the FBI believed Trump was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016.[680][681] Federal prosecutors closed the investigation in 2019,[682] but in 2021, the New York State Attorney General's Office and Manhattan District Attorney's Office opened a criminal investigations into Trump's business activities.[683] The Manhattan DA's Office subpoenaed the Trump Organization and AMI for records related to the payments[684] and Trump and the Trump Organization for eight years of tax returns.[685] \nIn March 2023, a New York grand jury indicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to book the hush money payments to Daniels as business expenses, in an attempt to influence the 2016 election.[686][687][688] The trial began in April 2024, and in May a jury convicted Trump on all 34 counts.[689] Sentencing is set for September 18, 2024.[690] \nCivil judgments against Trump\nIn September 2022, the attorney general of New York filed a civil fraud case against Trump, his three oldest children, and the Trump Organization.[691] During the investigation leading up to the lawsuit, Trump was fined $110,000 for failing to turn over records subpoenaed by the attorney general.[692] In an August 2022 deposition, Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 400 times.[693] The presiding judge ruled in September 2023 that Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization repeatedly committed fraud and ordered their New York business certificates canceled and their business entities sent into receivership for dissolution.[694] In February 2024, the court found Trump liable, ordered him to pay a penalty of more than $350 million plus interest, for a total exceeding $450 million, and barred him from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or legal entity for three years. Trump said he would appeal the verdict. The judge also ordered the company to be overseen by the monitor appointed by the court in 2023 and an independent director of compliance, and that any \"restructuring and potential dissolution\" would be the decision of the monitor.[695] \nIn May 2023, a New York jury in a federal lawsuit brought by journalist E. Jean Carroll in 2022 (\"Carroll II\") found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation and ordered him to pay her $5 million.[696] Trump asked for a new trial or a reduction of the award, arguing that the jury had not found him liable for rape. He also separately countersued Carroll for defamation. The judge for the two lawsuits ruled against Trump,[697][698] writing that Carroll's accusation of \"rape\" is \"substantially true\".[699] Trump appealed both decisions.[697][700] In January 2024, the jury in the defamation case brought by Carroll in 2019 (\"Carroll I\") ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83.3 million in damages. In March, Trump posted a $91.6 million bond and appealed.[701] \n2024 presidential campaign\nTrump rally in New Hampshire, January 2024 \nOn November 15, 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election and set up a fundraising account.[702][703] In March 2023, the campaign began diverting 10 percent of the donations to Trump's leadership PAC. Trump's campaign had paid $100 million towards his legal bills by March 2024.[704][705] \nIn December 2023, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled Trump disqualified for the Colorado Republican primary for his role in inciting the January 6, 2021, attack on Congress. In March 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court restored his name to the ballot in a unanimous decision, ruling that Colorado lacks the authority to enforce Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars insurrectionists from holding federal office.[706] \nDuring the campaign, Trump made increasingly violent and authoritarian statements.[708][709][710] He also said that he would weaponize the FBI and the Justice Department against his political opponents,[711][712] and used harsher, more dehumanizing anti-immigrant rhetoric than during his presidency.[713][714][715][716] \nOn July 13, 2024, Trump was cut on the ear by gunfire in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler Township, Pennsylvania.[717][718] The campaign declined to disclose medical or hospital records.[719] \nTwo days later, the 2024 Republican National Convention nominated Trump as their presidential candidate, with U.S. senator JD Vance as his running mate.[720] \nPublic image\nScholarly assessment and public approval surveys\nIn the C-SPAN \"Presidential Historians Survey 2021\",[721] historians ranked Trump as the fourth-worst president. He rated lowest in the leadership characteristics categories for moral authority and administrative skills.[722][723] The Siena College Research Institute's 2022 survey ranked Trump 43rd out of 45 presidents. He was ranked near the bottom in all categories except for luck, willingness to take risks, and party leadership, and he ranked last in several categories.[724] In 2018 and 2024, surveys of members of the American Political Science Association ranked Trump the worst president in American history.[725][726] \nTrump was the only president never to reach a 50 percent approval rating in the Gallup poll, which dates to 1938. His approval ratings showed a record-high partisan gap: 88 percent among Republicans and 7 percent among Democrats.[727] Until September 2020, the ratings were unusually stable, reaching a high of 49 percent and a low of 35 percent.[728] Trump finished his term with an approval rating between 29 and 34 percent—the lowest of any president since modern polling began—and a record-low average of 41 percent throughout his presidency.[727][729] \nIn Gallup's annual poll asking Americans to name the man they admire the most, Trump placed second to Obama in 2017 and 2018, tied with Obama for first in 2019, and placed first in 2020.[730][731] Since Gallup started conducting the poll in 1948, Trump is the first elected president not to be named most admired in his first year in office.[732] \nA Gallup poll in 134 countries comparing the approval ratings of U.S. leadership between 2016 and 2017 found that Trump led Obama in job approval in only 29 countries, most of them non-democracies;[733] approval of U.S. leadership plummeted among allies and G7 countries. Overall ratings were similar to those in the last two years of the George W. Bush presidency.[734] By mid-2020, only 16 percent of international respondents to a 13-nation Pew Research poll expressed confidence in Trump, lower than Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping.[735] \nFalse or misleading statements\nFact-checkers from The Washington Post,[736] the Toronto Star,[737] and CNN[738] compiled data on \"false or misleading claims\" (orange background), and \"false claims\" (violet foreground), respectively. \nAs a candidate and as president, Trump frequently made false statements in public remarks[739][154] to an extent unprecedented in American politics.[739][740][741] His falsehoods became a distinctive part of his political identity.[740] \nTrump's false and misleading statements were documented by fact-checkers, including at The Washington Post, which tallied 30,573 false or misleading statements made by Trump over his four-year term.[736] Trump's falsehoods increased in frequency over time, rising from about six false or misleading claims per day in his first year as president to 39 per day in his final year.[742] \nSome of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential, such as his repeated claim of the \"biggest inaugural crowd ever\".[743][744] Others had more far-reaching effects, such as his promotion of antimalarial drugs as an unproven treatment for COVID-19,[745][746] causing a U.S. shortage of these drugs and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia.[747][748] Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in England and Wales to the \"spread of radical Islamic terror\", served Trump's domestic political purposes.[749] Trump habitually does not apologize for his falsehoods.[750] \nUntil 2018, the media rarely referred to Trump's falsehoods as lies, including when he repeated demonstrably false statements.[751][752][753] \nIn 2020, Trump was a significant source of disinformation on mail-in voting and the COVID-19 pandemic.[754][755] His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices weakened public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election,[756][757] while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it.[439][754] \nPromotion of conspiracy theories\nBefore and throughout his presidency, Trump promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including Obama birtherism, the Clinton body count conspiracy theory, the conspiracy theory movement QAnon, the Global warming hoax theory, Trump Tower wiretapping allegations, a John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory involving Rafael Cruz, alleged foul-play in the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, alleged Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections, that Osama bin Laden was alive and Obama and Biden had members of Navy SEAL Team 6 killed,[758][759][760][761][762] and linking talk show host Joe Scarborough to the death of a staffer.[763] In at least two instances, Trump clarified to press that he believed the conspiracy theory in question.[760] \nDuring and since the 2020 presidential election, Trump promoted various conspiracy theories for his defeat including dead people voting,[764] voting machines changing or deleting Trump votes, fraudulent mail-in voting, throwing out Trump votes, and \"finding\" suitcases full of Biden votes.[765][766] \nIncitement of violence\nResearch suggests Trump's rhetoric caused an increased incidence of hate crimes.[767][768] During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.[769][770] Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes, including participants of the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol, cited Trump's rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive leniency.[771][772] A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases from August 2015 to April 2020 in which Trump was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against minorities.[773] \nTrump's social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined Twitter in 2009. He tweeted frequently during his 2016 campaign and as president until Twitter banned him after the January 6 attack, in the final days of his term.[774] Trump often used Twitter to communicate directly with the public and sideline the press.[775] In June 2017, the White House press secretary said that Trump's tweets were official presidential statements.[776] \nAfter years of criticism for allowing Trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checks in May 2020.[777] In response, Trump tweeted that social media platforms \"totally silence\" conservatives and that he would \"strongly regulate, or close them down\".[778] In the days after the storming of the Capitol, Trump was banned from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other platforms.[779] The loss of his social media presence diminished his ability to shape events[780][781] and prompted a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation shared on Twitter.[782] Trump's early attempts to re-establish a social media presence were unsuccessful.[783] In February 2022, he launched social media platform Truth Social where he only attracted a fraction of his Twitter following.[784] Elon Musk, after acquiring Twitter, reinstated Trump's Twitter account in November 2022.[785][786] Meta Platforms' two-year ban lapsed in January 2023, allowing Trump to return to Facebook and Instagram,[787] although in 2024 Trump continued to call the company an \"enemy of the people.\"[788] \nRelationship with the press\nTrump talking to the press, March 2017 \nTrump sought media attention throughout his career, sustaining a \"love-hate\" relationship with the press.[789] In the 2016 campaign, Trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[151] The New York Times writer Amy Chozick wrote in 2018 that Trump's media dominance enthralled the public and created \"must-see TV.\"[790] \nAs a candidate and as president, Trump frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the \"fake news media\" and \"the enemy of the people\".[791][792] In 2018, journalist Lesley Stahl recounted Trump's saying he intentionally discredited the media \"so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you\".[793] \nAs president, Trump mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he viewed as critical.[794] His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.[795] The Trump White House held about a hundred formal press briefings in 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two in 2019.[795] \nTrump also deployed the legal system to intimidate the press.[796] In early 2020, the Trump campaign sued The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about Russian election interference.[797][798] All the suits were dismissed.[799][800][801] \nRacial views\nMany of Trump's comments and actions have been considered racist.[802][803][804] In national polling, about half of respondents said that Trump is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists.[805][806] Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled Trump's political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[807][808] Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are a powerful indicator of support for Trump.[809] \nIn 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters.[50] He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. As of 2019, he maintained this position.[810] \nIn 2011, when he was reportedly considering a presidential run, he became the leading proponent of the racist \"birther\" conspiracy theory, alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the U.S.[811][812] In April, he claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the \"long-form\" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later said this made him \"very popular\".[813][814] In September 2016, amid pressure, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.[815] In 2017, he reportedly expressed birther views privately.[816] \nAccording to an analysis in Political Science Quarterly, Trump made \"explicitly racist appeals to whites\" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[817] In particular, his campaign launch speech drew widespread criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists\".[818][819] His later comments about a Mexican-American judge presiding over a civil suit regarding Trump University were also criticized as racist.[820] \nAnswering questions about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville \nTrump's comments on the 2017 Unite the Right rally, condemning \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\" and stating that there were \"very fine people on both sides\", were widely criticized as implying a moral equivalence between the white supremacist demonstrators and the counter-protesters.[821][822][823][824] \nIn a January 2018 discussion of immigration legislation, Trump reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as \"shithole countries\".[825] His remarks were condemned as racist.[826][827] \nIn July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen—all from minorities, three of whom are native-born Americans—should \"go back\" to the countries they \"came from\".[828] Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240–187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his \"racist comments\".[829] White nationalist publications and social media praised his remarks, which continued over the following days.[830] Trump continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign.[831] \nMisogyny and allegations of sexual misconduct\nTrump has a history of insulting and belittling women when speaking to the media and on social media.[832][833] He has made lewd comments about women[834][835] and has disparaged women's physical appearances and referred to them using derogatory epithets.[833][836][837] At least 26 women publicly accused Trump of rape, kissing, and groping without consent; looking under women's skirts; and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants.[838][839][840] Trump has denied the allegations.[840] \nIn October 2016, two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 \"hot mic\" recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that \"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy.\"[841] The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign[842] and caused outrage across the political spectrum.[843] \nPopular culture\nTrump has been the subject of comedy and caricature on television, in films, and in comics. He was named in hundreds of hip hop songs from 1989 until 2015; most of these cast Trump in a positive light, but they turned largely negative after he began running for office.[844] \nHonors and awards\nDonald Trump has been granted thiry-six awards and accolades, both domestic [845] and international.[846] Three honorary degrees were later revoked,[847][848][849] and a public square named after him was renamed.[850] \nNotes\n^ Presidential elections in the U.S. are decided by the Electoral College. Each state names a number of electors equal to its representation in Congress and (in most states) all electors vote for the winner of their state's popular vote. \nReferences\n^ \"Certificate of Birth\".

  "text": "Home | Donald J. Trump\n\"THEY’RE NOT AFTER ME, \nTHEY’RE AFTER YOU \n…I’M JUST STANDING \nIN THE WAY!”\nDONALD J. TRUMP, 45th President of the United States \nContribute VOLUNTEER \nAgenda47 Platform\nAmerica needs determined Republican Leadership at every level of Government to address the core threats to our very survival: Our disastrously Open Border, our weakened Economy, crippling restrictions on American Energy Production, our depleted Military, attacks on the American System of Justice, and much more. \nTo make clear our commitment, we offer to the American people the 2024 GOP Platform to Make America Great Again! It is a forward-looking Agenda that begins with the following twenty promises that we will accomplish very quickly when we win the White House and Republican Majorities in the House and Senate. \nPlatform \nI AM YOUR VOICE. AMERICA FIRST!\nPresident Trump Will Stop China From Owning America\nI will ensure America's future remains firmly in America's hands!\nPresident Donald J. Trump Calls for Probe into Intelligence Community’s Role in Online Censorship\nThe ‘Twitter Files’ prove that we urgently need my plan to dismantle the illegal censorship regime — a regime like nobody’s ever seen in the history of our country or most other countries for that matter,” President Trump said.\nPresident Donald J. Trump — Free Speech Policy Initiative\nPresident Donald J. Trump announced a new policy initiative aimed to dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech.\nPresident Donald J. Trump Declares War on Cartels\nJoe Biden prepares to make his first-ever trip to the southern border that he deliberately erased, President Trump announced that when he is president again, it will be the official policy of the United States to take down the drug cartels just as we took down ISIS.\nAgenda47: Ending the Nightmare of the Homeless, Drug Addicts, and Dangerously Deranged\nFor a small fraction of what we spend upon Ukraine, we could take care of every homeless veteran in America. Our veterans are being treated horribly.\nAgenda47: Liberating America from Biden’s Regulatory Onslaught\nNo longer will unelected members of the Washington Swamp be allowed to act as the fourth branch of our Republic.\nAgenda47: Firing the Radical Marxist Prosecutors Destroying America\nIf we cannot restore the fair and impartial rule of law, we will not be a free country.\nAgenda47: President Trump Announces Plan to Stop the America Last Warmongers and Globalists\nPresident Donald J. Trump announced his plan to defeat the America Last warmongers and globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.\nAgenda47: President Trump Announces Plan to End Crime and Restore Law and Order\nPresident Donald J. Trump unveiled his new plan to stop out-of-control crime and keep all Americans safe. In his first term, President Trump reduced violent crime and stood strongly with America’s law enforcement. On Joe Biden’s watch, violent crime has skyrocketed and communities have become less safe as he defunded, defamed, and dismantled police forces. www.DonaldJTrump.com Text TRUMP to 88022\nAgenda47: President Trump on Making America Energy Independent Again\nBiden's War on Energy Is The Key Driver of the Worst Inflation in 58 Years!

The city serves as the cultural and financial center of the New England region of the Northeastern United States. It has an area of 48.4 sq mi (125 km2)[10] and a population of 675,647 as of the 2020 census, making it the third-largest city in the Northeast after New York City and Philadelphia.[4] The larger Greater Boston metropolitan statistical area, which includes and surrounds the city, has a population of 4,919,179 as of 2023, making it the largest in New England and eleventh-largest in the country.[11][12][13] \nBoston was founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers. The city was named after Boston, Lincolnshire, England.[14][15] During the American Revolution, Boston was home to several events that proved central to the revolution and subsequent Revolutionary War, including the Boston Massacre (1770), the Boston Tea Party (1773), Paul Revere's Midnight Ride (1775), the Battle of Bunker Hill (1775), and the Siege of Boston (1775–1776). Following American independence from Great Britain, the city continued to play an important role as a port, manufacturing hub, and center for education and culture.[16][17] The city also expanded significantly beyond the original peninsula by filling in land and annexing neighboring towns. Boston's many firsts include the United States' first public park (Boston Common, 1634),[18] the first public school (Boston Latin School, 1635),[19] and the first subway system (Tremont Street subway, 1897).[20] \nBoston has emerged as a national leader in higher education and research[21] and the largest biotechnology hub in the world.[22] The city is also a national leader in scientific research, law, medicine, engineering, and business. With nearly 5,000 startup companies, the city is considered a global pioneer in innovation and entrepreneurship,[23][24][25] and more recently in artificial intelligence.[26] Boston's economy also includes finance,[27] professional and business services, information technology, and government activities.[28] Boston households provide the highest average rate of philanthropy in the nation,[29] and the city's businesses and institutions rank among the top in the nation for environmental sustainability and new investment.[30] \nIsaac Johnson, in one of his last official acts as the leader of the Charlestown community before he died on September 30, 1630, named the then-new settlement across the river \"Boston\". The settlement's name came from Johnson's hometown of Boston, Lincolnshire, from which he, his wife (namesake of the Arbella) and John Cotton (grandfather of Cotton Mather) had emigrated to New England. The name of the English town ultimately derives from its patron saint, St. Botolph, in whose church John Cotton served as the rector until his emigration with Johnson. In early sources, Lincolnshire's Boston was known as \"St. Botolph's town\", later contracted to \"Boston\". Before this renaming, the settlement on the peninsula had been known as \"Shawmut\" by William Blaxton and \"Tremontaine\"[31] by the Puritan settlers he had invited.[32][33][34][35][36] \nPrior to European colonization, the region surrounding present-day Boston was inhabited by the Massachusett people who had small, seasonal communities.[37][38] When a group of settlers led by John Winthrop arrived in 1630, the Shawmut Peninsula was nearly empty of the Native people, as many had died of European diseases brought by early settlers and traders.[39][40] Archaeological excavations unearthed one of the oldest fishweirs in New England on Boylston Street, which Native people constructed as early as 7,000 years before European arrival in the Western Hemisphere.[38][37][41] \nEuropean settlement\n[edit]\nThe first European to live in what would become Boston was a Cambridge-educated Anglican cleric named William Blaxton. He was the person most directly responsible for the foundation of Boston by Puritan colonists in 1630. This occurred after Blaxton invited one of their leaders, Isaac Johnson, to cross Back Bay from the failing colony of Charlestown and share the peninsula. The Puritans made the crossing in September 1630.[42][43][44] \nPuritan influence on Boston began even before the settlement was founded with the 1629 Cambridge Agreement. This document created the Massachusetts Bay Colony and was signed by its first governor John Winthrop. Puritan ethics and their focus on education also influenced the early history of the city. America's first public school, Boston Latin School, was founded in Boston in 1635.[19][45] \nBoston was the largest town in the Thirteen Colonies until Philadelphia outgrew it in the mid-18th century.[46] Boston's oceanfront location made it a lively port, and the then-town primarily engaged in shipping and fishing during its colonial days. Boston was a primary stop on a Caribbean trade route and imported large amounts of molasses, which led to the creation of Boston baked beans.[47] \nBoston's economy stagnated in the decades prior to the Revolution. By the mid-18th century, New York City and Philadelphia had surpassed Boston in wealth. During this period, Boston encountered financial difficulties even as other cities in New England grew rapidly.[48][49] \nRevolution and the siege of Boston\n[edit]\nIn 1773, a group of angered Bostonian citizens threw a shipment of tea by the East India Company into Boston Harbor in protest of the Tea Act, an event known as the Boston Tea Party that escalated the American Revolution. Map showing a British tactical evaluation of Boston in 1775 \nThe weather continuing boisterous the next day and night, giving the enemy time to improve their works, to bring up their cannon, and to put themselves in such a state of defence, that I could promise myself little success in attacking them under all the disadvantages I had to encounter. \nWilliam Howe, 5th Viscount Howe, in a letter to William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, about the British army's decision to leave Boston, dated March 21, 1776.[50]\nMany crucial events of the American Revolution[51] occurred in or near Boston. The then-town's mob presence, along with the colonists' growing lack of faith in either Britain or its Parliament, fostered a revolutionary spirit there.[48] When the British parliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765, a Boston mob ravaged the homes of Andrew Oliver, the official tasked with enforcing the Act, and Thomas Hutchinson, then the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts.[48][52] The British sent two regiments to Boston in 1768 in an attempt to quell the angry colonists. This did not sit well with the colonists, however. In 1770, during the Boston Massacre, British troops shot into a crowd that had started to violently harass them. The colonists compelled the British to withdraw their troops. The event was widely publicized and fueled a revolutionary movement in America.[49] \nIn 1773, Parliament passed the Tea Act. Many of the colonists saw the act as an attempt to force them to accept the taxes established by the Townshend Acts. The act prompted the Boston Tea Party, where a group of angered Bostonians threw an entire shipment of tea sent by the East India Company into Boston Harbor. The Boston Tea Party was a key event leading up to the revolution, as the British government responded furiously with the Coercive Acts, demanding compensation for the destroyed tea from the Bostonians.[48] This angered the colonists further and led to the American Revolutionary War. The war began in the area surrounding Boston with the Battles of Lexington and Concord.[48][53] \nBoston itself was besieged for almost a year during the siege of Boston, which began on April 19, 1775. The New England militia impeded the movement of the British Army. Sir William Howe, then the commander-in-chief of the British forces in North America, led the British army in the siege. On June 17, the British captured Charlestown (now part of Boston) during the Battle of Bunker Hill. The British army outnumbered the militia stationed there, but it was a pyrrhic victory for the British because their army suffered irreplaceable casualties. It was also a testament to the skill and training of the militia, as their stubborn defense made it difficult for the British to capture Charlestown without suffering further irreplaceable casualties.[54][55] \nSeveral weeks later, George Washington took over the militia after the Continental Congress established the Continental Army to unify the revolutionary effort. Both sides faced difficulties and supply shortages in the siege, and the fighting was limited to small-scale raids and skirmishes. The narrow Boston Neck, which at that time was only about a hundred feet wide, impeded Washington's ability to invade Boston, and a long stalemate ensued. A young officer, Rufus Putnam, came up with a plan to make portable fortifications out of wood that could be erected on the frozen ground under cover of darkness. Putnam supervised this effort, which successfully installed both the fortifications and dozens of cannons on Dorchester Heights that Henry Knox had laboriously brought through the snow from Fort Ticonderoga. The astonished British awoke the next morning to see a large array of cannons bearing down on them. General Howe is believed to have said that the Americans had done more in one night than his army could have done in six months. The British Army attempted a cannon barrage for two hours, but their shot could not reach the colonists' cannons at such a height. The British gave up, boarded their ships, and sailed away. This has become known as \"Evacuation Day\", which Boston still celebrates each year on March 17. After this, Washington was so impressed that he made Rufus Putnam his chief engineer.[53][54][56] \nPost-revolution and the War of 1812\n[edit]\nState Street in 1801 \nAfter the Revolution, Boston's long seafaring tradition helped make it one of the nation's busiest ports for both domestic and international trade. Boston's harbor activity was significantly curtailed by the Embargo Act of 1807 (adopted during the Napoleonic Wars) and the War of 1812. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the meantime. Manufacturing became an important component of the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. The small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.[57] \nDuring this period, Boston flourished culturally as well. It was admired for its rarefied literary life and generous artistic patronage.[58][59] Members of old Boston families—eventually dubbed the Boston Brahmins—came to be regarded as the nation's social and cultural elites.[60] They are often associated with the American upper class, Harvard University,[61] and the Episcopal Church.[62][63] \nBoston was a prominent port of the Atlantic slave trade in the New England Colonies, but was soon overtaken by Salem, Massachusetts and Newport, Rhode Island.[64] Boston eventually became a center of the American abolitionist movement.[65] The city reacted largely negatively to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850,[66] contributing to President Franklin Pierce's attempt to make an example of Boston after Anthony Burns's attempt to escape to freedom.[67][68] \nIn 1822,[16] the citizens of Boston voted to change the official name from the \"Town of Boston\" to the \"City of Boston\", and on March 19, 1822, the people of Boston accepted the charter incorporating the city.[69] At the time Boston was chartered as a city, the population was about 46,226, while the area of the city was only 4.8 sq mi (12 km2).[69] \nBoston, as the Eagle and the Wild Goose See It, an 1860 photograph by James Wallace Black, was the first recorded aerial photograph. \nIn the 1820s, Boston's population grew rapidly, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically with the first wave of European immigrants. Irish immigrants dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period, especially following the Great Famine; by 1850, about 35,000 Irish lived in Boston.[70] In the latter half of the 19th century, the city saw increasing numbers of Irish, Germans, Lebanese, Syrians,[71] French Canadians, and Russian and Polish Jews settling there. By the end of the 19th century, Boston's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants with their residence yielding lasting cultural change. Italians became the largest inhabitants of the North End,[72] Irish dominated South Boston and Charlestown, and Russian Jews lived in the West End. Irish and Italian immigrants brought with them Roman Catholicism. Currently, Catholics make up Boston's largest religious community,[73] and the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics since the early 20th century; prominent figures include the Kennedys, Tip O'Neill, and John F. Fitzgerald.[74] \nBetween 1631 and 1890, the city tripled its area through land reclamation by filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between wharves along the waterfront. Reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the South End, the West End, the Financial District, and Chinatown.[75] \nAfter the Great Boston fire of 1872, workers used building rubble as landfill along the downtown waterfront. During the mid-to-late 19th century, workers filled almost 600 acres (240 ha) of brackish Charles River marshlands west of Boston Common with gravel brought by rail from the hills of Needham Heights. The city annexed the adjacent towns of South Boston (1804), East Boston (1836), Roxbury (1868), Dorchester (including present-day Mattapan and a portion of South Boston) (1870), Brighton (including present-day Allston) (1874), West Roxbury (including present-day Jamaica Plain and Roslindale) (1874), Charlestown (1874), and Hyde Park (1912).[76][77] Other proposals were unsuccessful for the annexation of Brookline, Cambridge,[78] and Chelsea.[79][80] \nHaymarket Square in 1909 \nMany architecturally significant buildings were built during these early years of the 20th century: Horticultural Hall,[81] the Tennis and Racquet Club,[82] Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum,[83] Fenway Studios,[84] Jordan Hall,[85] and the Boston Opera House. The Longfellow Bridge,[86] built in 1906, was mentioned by Robert McCloskey in Make Way for Ducklings, describing its \"salt and pepper shakers\" feature.[87] Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, opened in 1912,[88] with the Boston Garden opening in 1928.[89] Logan International Airport opened on September 8, 1923.[90] \nBoston went into decline by the early to mid-20th century, as factories became old and obsolete and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labor elsewhere.[91] Boston responded by initiating various urban renewal projects, under the direction of the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) established in 1957. In 1958, BRA initiated a project to improve the historic West End neighborhood. Extensive demolition was met with strong public opposition, and thousands of families were displaced.[92] \nThe BRA continued implementing eminent domain projects, including the clearance of the vibrant Scollay Square area for construction of the modernist style Government Center. In 1965, the Columbia Point Health Center opened in the Dorchester neighborhood, the first Community Health Center in the United States. It mostly served the massive Columbia Point public housing complex adjoining it, which was built in 1953. The health center is still in operation and was rededicated in 1990 as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center.[93] The Columbia Point complex itself was redeveloped and revitalized from 1984 to 1990 into a mixed-income residential development called Harbor Point Apartments.[94] \nBy the 1970s, the city's economy had begun to recover after 30 years of economic downturn. A large number of high-rises were constructed in the Financial District and in Boston's Back Bay during this period.[95] This boom continued into the mid-1980s and resumed after a few pauses. Hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Brigham and Women's Hospital lead the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Schools such as the Boston Architectural College, Boston College, Boston University, the Harvard Medical School, Tufts University School of Medicine, Northeastern University, Massachusetts College of Art and Design, Wentworth Institute of Technology, Berklee College of Music, the Boston Conservatory, and many others attract students to the area. Nevertheless, the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over desegregation busing, which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s.[96] Boston has also experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century,[97] with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s when the city's rent control regime was struck down by statewide ballot proposition.[98] \nThe Charles River in front of Boston's Back Bay neighborhood, in 2013 \nBoston is an intellectual, technological, and political center. However, it has lost some important regional institutions,[99] including the loss to mergers and acquisitions of local financial institutions such as FleetBoston Financial, which was acquired by Charlotte-based Bank of America in 2004.[100] Boston-based department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene's have both merged into the New York City–based Macy's.[101] The 1993 acquisition of The Boston Globe by The New York Times[102] was reversed in 2013 when it was re-sold to Boston businessman John W. Henry. In 2016, it was announced General Electric would be moving its corporate headquarters from Connecticut to the Seaport District in Boston, joining many other companies in this rapidly developing neighborhood.[103] The city also saw the completion of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project, known as the Big Dig, in 2007 after many delays and cost overruns.[104] \nOn April 15, 2013, two Chechen Islamist brothers detonated a pair of bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring roughly 264.[105] The subsequent search for the bombers led to a lock-down of Boston and surrounding municipalities. The region showed solidarity during this time as symbolized by the slogan Boston Strong.[106] \nIn 2016, Boston briefly shouldered a bid as the U.S. applicant for the 2024 Summer Olympics. The bid was supported by the mayor and a coalition of business leaders and local philanthropists, but was eventually dropped due to public opposition.[107] The USOC then selected Los Angeles to be the American candidate with Los Angeles ultimately securing the right to host the 2028 Summer Olympics.[108] Nevertheless, Boston is one of eleven U.S. cities which will host matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with games taking place at Gillette Stadium.[109] \nThe geographical center of Boston is in Roxbury. Due north of the center we find the South End. This is not to be confused with South Boston which lies directly east from the South End. North of South Boston is East Boston and southwest of East Boston is the North End \nUnknown, A local colloquialism[110]\nBoston and its neighbors as seen from Sentinel-2 with Boston Harbor (center). Boston itself lies on the southern bank of the Charles River. On the river's northern bank, the outlines of Cambridge and Watertown can be seen; to the west are Brookline and Newton; to the south lie Quincy and Milton. An 1877 panoramic map of Boston \nBoston has an area of 89.63 sq mi (232.1 km2). Of this area, 48.4 sq mi (125.4 km2), or 54%, of it is land and 41.2 sq mi (106.7 km2), or 46%, of it is water. The city's official elevation, as measured at Logan International Airport, is 19 ft (5.8 m) above sea level.[111] The highest point in Boston is Bellevue Hill at 330 ft (100 m) above sea level, and the lowest point is at sea level.[112] Boston is situated next to Boston Harbor, an arm of Massachusetts Bay, itself an arm of the Atlantic Ocean. \nBoston is surrounded by the Greater Boston metropolitan region. It is bordered to the east by the town of Winthrop and the Boston Harbor Islands, to the northeast by the cities of Revere, Chelsea and Everett, to the north by the cities of Somerville and Cambridge, to the northwest by Watertown, to the west by the city of Newton and town of Brookline, to the southwest by the town of Dedham and small portions of Needham and Canton, and to the southeast by the town of Milton, and the city of Quincy. \nThe Charles River separates Boston's Allston-Brighton, Fenway-Kenmore and Back Bay neighborhoods from Watertown and Cambridge, and most of Boston from its own Charlestown neighborhood. The Neponset River forms the boundary between Boston's southern neighborhoods and Quincy and Milton. The Mystic River separates Charlestown from Chelsea and Everett, and Chelsea Creek and Boston Harbor separate East Boston from Downtown, the North End, and the Seaport.[113] \nJohn Hancock Tower at 200 Clarendon Street is the tallest building in Boston, with a roof height of 790 ft (240 m). \nBoston is sometimes called a \"city of neighborhoods\" because of the profusion of diverse subsections.[114][115] The city government's Office of Neighborhood Services has officially designated 23 neighborhoods:[116] \nAllston\nBack Bay\nBay Village\nBeacon Hill\nBrighton\nCharlestown\nChinatown\nDorchester\nDowntown\nEast Boston\nFenway\nHyde Park\nJamaica Plain\nMattapan\nMission Hill\nNorth End\nRoslindale\nRoxbury\nSeaport\nSouth Boston\nthe South End\nthe West End\nWest Roxbury\nMore than two-thirds of inner Boston's modern land area did not exist when the city was founded. Instead, it was created via the gradual filling in of the surrounding tidal areas over the centuries.[75] This was accomplished using earth from the leveling or lowering of Boston's three original hills (the \"Trimountain\", after which Tremont Street is named), as well as with gravel brought by train from Needham to fill the Back Bay.[17] \nDowntown and its immediate surroundings (including the Financial District, Government Center, and South Boston) consist largely of low-rise masonry buildings – often federal style and Greek revival – interspersed with modern high-rises.[117] Back Bay includes many prominent landmarks, such as the Boston Public Library, Christian Science Center, Copley Square, Newbury Street, and New England's two tallest buildings: the John Hancock Tower and the Prudential Center.[118] Near the John Hancock Tower is the old John Hancock Building with its prominent illuminated beacon, the color of which forecasts the weather.[119] Smaller commercial areas are interspersed among areas of single-family homes and wooden/brick multi-family row houses. The South End Historic District is the largest surviving contiguous Victorian-era neighborhood in the US.[120] \nThe geography of downtown and South Boston was particularly affected by the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (which ran from 1991 to 2007, and was known unofficially as the \"Big Dig\"). That project removed the elevated Central Artery and incorporated new green spaces and open areas.[121] \nPopulation density and elevation above sea level in Greater Boston as of 2010 \nAs a coastal city built largely on fill, sea-level rise is of major concern to the city government. A climate action plan from 2019 anticipates 2 ft (1 m) to more than 7 ft (2 m) of sea-level rise in Boston by the end of the century.[122] Many older buildings in certain areas of Boston are supported by wooden piles driven into the area's fill; these piles remain sound if submerged in water, but are subject to dry rot if exposed to air for long periods.[123] Groundwater levels have been dropping in many areas of the city, due in part to an increase in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground. The Boston Groundwater Trust coordinates monitoring groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells.[124] \nThe city developed a climate action plan covering carbon reduction in buildings, transportation, and energy use. The first such plan was commissioned in 2007, with updates released in 2011, 2014, and 2019.[125] This plan includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, which requires the city's larger buildings to disclose their yearly energy and water use statistics and to partake in an energy assessment every five years.[126] A separate initiative, Resilient Boston Harbor, lays out neighborhood-specific recommendations for coastal resilience.[127] In 2013, Mayor Thomas Menino introduced the Renew Boston Whole Building Incentive which reduces the cost of living in buildings that are deemed energy efficient.[128] \nBoston's skyline in the background with fall foliage in the foreground\nA graph of cumulative winter snowfall at Logan International Airport from 1938 to 2015. The four winters with the most snowfall are highlighted. The snowfall data, which was collected by NOAA, is from the weather station at the airport.\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Boston has either a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa) under the 0 °C (32.0 °F) isotherm or a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) under the −3 °C (26.6 °F) isotherm.[129] Summers are warm to hot and humid, while winters are cold and stormy, with occasional periods of heavy snow. Spring and fall are usually cool and mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and the position of the jet stream. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the influence of the Atlantic Ocean. However, in winter, areas near the immediate coast often see more rain than snow, as warm air is sometimes drawn off the Atlantic.[130] The city lies at the border between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b (away from the coastline) and 7a (close to the coastline).[131] \nThe hottest month is July, with a mean temperature of 74.1 °F (23.4 °C). The coldest month is January, with a mean temperature of 29.9 °F (−1.2 °C). Periods exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) in summer and below freezing in winter are not uncommon but tend to be fairly short, with about 13 and 25 days per year seeing each, respectively.[132] \nSub- 0 °F (−18 °C) readings usually occur every 3 to 5 years.[133] The most recent sub- 0 °F (−18 °C) reading occurred on February 4, 2023, when the temperature dipped down to −10 °F (−23 °C); this was the lowest temperature reading in the city since 1957.[132] In addition, several decades may pass between 100 °F (38 °C) readings; the last such reading occurred on July 24, 2022.[132] The city's average window for freezing temperatures is November 9 through April 5.[132][a] Official temperature records have ranged from −18 °F (−28 °C) on February 9, 1934, up to 104 °F (40 °C) on July 4, 1911. The record cold daily maximum is 2 °F (−17 °C) on December 30, 1917, while the record warm daily minimum is 83 °F (28 °C) on both August 2, 1975 and July 21, 2019.[134][132] \nBoston averages 43.6 in (1,110 mm) of precipitation a year, with 49.2 in (125 cm) of snowfall per season.[132] Most snowfall occurs from mid-November through early April, and snow is rare in May and October.[135][136] There is also high year-to-year variability in snowfall; for instance, the winter of 2011–12 saw only 9.3 in (23.6 cm) of accumulating snow, but the previous winter, the corresponding figure was 81.0 in (2.06 m).[132][b] The city's coastal location on the North Atlantic makes the city very prone to nor'easters, which can produce large amounts of snow and rain.[130] \nFog is fairly common, particularly in spring and early summer. Due to its coastal location, the city often receives sea breezes, especially in the late spring, when water temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be more than 20 °F (11 °C) colder than a few miles inland, sometimes dropping by that amount near midday.[137][138] Thunderstorms typically occur from May to September; occasionally, they can become severe, with large hail, damaging winds, and heavy downpours.[130] Although downtown Boston has never been struck by a violent tornado, the city itself has experienced many tornado warnings. Damaging storms are more common to areas north, west, and northwest of the city.[139] \nv\nt\ne\nClimate data for Boston, Massachusetts (Logan Airport), 1991−2020 normals,[c] extremes 1872−present[d]\nMonth Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year \nRecord high °F (°C) 74\n(23) \t73\n(23) \t89\n(32) \t94\n(34) \t97\n(36) \t100\n(38) \t104\n(40) \t102\n(39) \t102\n(39) \t90\n(32) \t83\n(28) \t76\n(24) \t104\n(40) \t\nMean maximum °F (°C) 58.3\n(14.6) \t57.9\n(14.4) \t67.0\n(19.4) \t79.9\n(26.6) \t88.1\n(31.2) \t92.2\n(33.4) \t95.0\n(35.0) \t93.7\n(34.3) \t88.9\n(31.6) \t79.6\n(26.4) \t70.2\n(21.2) \t61.2\n(16.2) \t96.4\n(35.8) \t\nMean daily maximum °F (°C) 36.8\n(2.7) \t39.0\n(3.9) \t45.5\n(7.5) \t56.4\n(13.6) \t66.5\n(19.2) \t76.2\n(24.6) \t82.1\n(27.8) \t80.4\n(26.9) \t73.1\n(22.8) \t62.1\n(16.7) \t51.6\n(10.9) \t42.2\n(5.7) \t59.3\n(15.2) \t\nDaily mean °F (°C) 29.9\n(−1.2) \t31.8\n(−0.1) \t38.3\n(3.5) \t48.6\n(9.2) \t58.4\n(14.7) \t68.0\n(20.0) \t74.1\n(23.4) \t72.7\n(22.6) \t65.6\n(18.7) \t54.8\n(12.7) \t44.7\n(7.1) \t35.7\n(2.1) \t51.9\n(11.1) \t\nMean daily minimum °F (°C) 23.1\n(−4.9) \t24.6\n(−4.1) \t31.1\n(−0.5) \t40.8\n(4.9) \t50.3\n(10.2) \t59.7\n(15.4) \t66.0\n(18.9) \t65.1\n(18.4) \t58.2\n(14.6) \t47.5\n(8.6) \t37.9\n(3.3) \t29.2\n(−1.6) \t44.5\n(6.9) \t\nMean minimum °F (°C) 4.8\n(−15.1) \t8.3\n(−13.2) \t15.6\n(−9.1) \t31.0\n(−0.6) \t41.2\n(5.1) \t49.7\n(9.8) \t58.6\n(14.8) \t57.7\n(14.3) \t46.7\n(8.2) \t35.1\n(1.7) \t24.4\n(−4.2) \t13.1\n(−10.5) \t2.6\n(−16.3) \t\nRecord low °F (°C) −13\n(−25) \t−18\n(−28) \t−8\n(−22) \t11\n(−12) \t31\n(−1) \t41\n(5) \t50\n(10) \t46\n(8) \t34\n(1) \t25\n(−4) \t−2\n(−19) \t−17\n(−27) \t−18\n(−28) \t\nAverage precipitation inches (mm) 3.39\n(86) \t3.21\n(82) \t4.17\n(106) \t3.63\n(92) \t3.25\n(83) \t3.89\n(99) \t3.27\n(83) \t3.23\n(82) \t3.56\n(90) \t4.03\n(102) \t3.66\n(93) \t4.30\n(109) \t43.59\n(1,107) \t\nAverage snowfall inches (cm) 14.3\n(36) \t14.4\n(37) \t9.0\n(23) \t1.6\n(4.1) \t0.0\n(0.0) \t0.0\n(0.0) \t0.0\n(0.0) \t0.0\n(0.0) \t0.0\n(0.0) \t0.2\n(0.51) \t0.7\n(1.8) \t9.0\n(23) \t49.2\n(125) \t\nAverage precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 11.8 \t10.6 \t11.6 \t11.6 \t11.8 \t10.9 \t9.4 \t9.0 \t9.0 \t10.5 \t10.3 \t11.9 \t128.4 \t\nAverage snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) 6.6 \t6.2 \t4.4 \t0.8 \t0.0 \t0.0 \t0.0 \t0.0 \t0.0 \t0.2 \t0.6 \t4.2 \t23.0 \t\nAverage relative humidity (%) 62.3 \t62.0 \t63.1 \t63.0 \t66.7 \t68.5 \t68.4 \t70.8 \t71.8 \t68.5 \t67.5 \t65.4 \t66.5 \t\nAverage dew point °F (°C) 16.5\n(−8.6) \t17.6\n(−8.0) \t25.2\n(−3.8) \t33.6\n(0.9) \t45.0\n(7.2) \t55.2\n(12.9) \t61.0\n(16.1) \t60.4\n(15.8) \t53.8\n(12.1) \t42.8\n(6.0) \t33.4\n(0.8) \t22.1\n(−5.5) \t38.9\n(3.8) \t\nMean monthly sunshine hours 163.4 \t168.4 \t213.7 \t227.2 \t267.3 \t286.5 \t300.9 \t277.3 \t237.1 \t206.3 \t143.2 \t142.3 \t2,633.6 \t\nPercent possible sunshine 56 \t57 \t58 \t57 \t59 \t63 \t65 \t64 \t63 \t60 \t49 \t50 \t59 \t\nAverage ultraviolet index 1 \t2 \t4 \t5 \t7 \t8 \t8 \t8 \t6 \t4 \t2 \t1 \t5 \t\nSource 1: NOAA (relative humidity, dew point and sun 1961−1990)[141][132][142] \t\nSource 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[143] \t\nClimate data for Boston, Massachusetts \nSee or edit raw graph data. \nHistorical population\nYearPop.±%\n16804,500\t— \t\n16907,000\t+55.6%\t\n17006,700\t−4.3%\t\n17109,000\t+34.3%\t\n172210,567\t+17.4%\t\n174216,382\t+55.0%\t\n176515,520\t−5.3%\t\n179018,320\t+18.0%\t\n180024,937\t+36.1%\t\n181033,787\t+35.5%\t\n182043,298\t+28.1%\t\n183061,392\t+41.8%\t\n184093,383\t+52.1%\t\n1850136,881\t+46.6%\t\n1860177,840\t+29.9%\t\n1870250,526\t+40.9%\t\n1880362,839\t+44.8%\t\n1890448,477\t+23.6%\t\n1900560,892\t+25.1%\t\n1910670,585\t+19.6%\t\n1920748,060\t+11.6%\t\n1930781,188\t+4.4%\t\n1940770,816\t−1.3%\t\n1950801,444\t+4.0%\t\n1960697,197\t−13.0%\t\n1970641,071\t−8.1%\t\n1980562,994\t−12.2%\t\n1990574,283\t+2.0%\t\n2000589,141\t+2.6%\t\n2010617,594\t+4.8%\t\n2020675,647\t+9.4%\t\n2022*650,706\t−3.7%\t\n*=population estimate. \nSource: United States census records and Population Estimates Program data.[144][145][146][147][148][149][150][151][152][153][154][155][156]\n2010–2020[4]\nSource: U.S. Decennial Census[157]\t\nPacked circles diagram showing estimates of the ethnic origins of people in Boston in 2021 \nHistorical racial/ethnic composition \nRace/ethnicity 2020[158] 2010[159] 1990[160] 1970[160] 1940[160] \nNon-Hispanic White\t44.7%\t47.0%\t59.0%\t79.5%[e]\t96.6% \t\nBlack\t22.0%\t24.4%\t23.8%\t16.3%\t3.1% \t\nHispanic or Latino (of any race)\t19.5%\t17.5%\t10.8%\t2.8%[e]\t0.1% \t\nAsian\t9.7%\t8.9%\t5.3%\t1.3%\t0.2% \t\nTwo or more races\t3.2%\t3.9%\t–\t–\t– \t\nNative American\t0.2%\t0.4%\t0.3%\t0.2%\t– \t\nIn 2020, Boston was estimated to have 691,531 residents living in 266,724 households[4]—a 12% population increase over 2010. The city is the third-most densely populated large U.S. city of over half a million residents, and the most densely populated state capital. Some 1.2 million persons may be within Boston's boundaries during work hours, and as many as 2 million during special events. This fluctuation of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.[161] \nIn the city, 21.9% of the population was aged 19 and under, 14.3% was from 20 to 24, 33.2% from 25 to 44, 20.4% from 45 to 64, and 10.1% was 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30.8 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.9 males.[162] There were 252,699 households, of which 20.4% had children under the age of 18 living in them, 25.5% were married couples living together, 16.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 54.0% were non-families. 37.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.26 and the average family size was 3.08.[162] \nThe median household income in Boston was $51,739, while the median income for a family was $61,035. Full-time year-round male workers had a median income of $52,544 versus $46,540 for full-time year-round female workers. The per capita income for the city was $33,158. 21.4% of the population and 16.0% of families were below the poverty line. Of the total population, 28.8% of those under the age of 18 and 20.4% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.[163] Boston has a significant racial wealth gap with White Bostonians having an median net worth of $247,500 compared to an $8 median net worth for non-immigrant Black residents and $0 for Dominican immigrant residents.[164] \nFrom the 1950s to the end of the 20th century, the proportion of non-Hispanic Whites in the city declined. In 2000, non-Hispanic Whites made up 49.5% of the city's population, making the city majority minority for the first time. However, in the 21st century, the city has experienced significant gentrification, during which affluent Whites have moved into formerly non-White areas. In 2006, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated non-Hispanic Whites again formed a slight majority but as of 2010, in part due to the housing crash, as well as increased efforts to make more affordable housing more available, the non-White population has rebounded. This may also have to do with increased Latin American and Asian populations and more clarity surrounding U.S. Census statistics, which indicate a non-Hispanic White population of 47% (some reports give slightly lower figures).[165][166][167] \nU.S. Navy sailors march in Boston's annual Saint Patrick's Day parade. Irish Americans constitute the largest ethnicity in Boston. Armenian American family in Boston, 1908 Chinatown with its paifang gate is home to several Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants. \nAfrican-Americans comprise 22% of the city's population. People of Irish descent form the second-largest single ethnic group in the city, making up 15.8% of the population, followed by Italians, accounting for 8.3% of the population. People of West Indian and Caribbean ancestry are another sizable group, collectively at over 15%.[168] \nIn Greater Boston, these numbers grew significantly, with 150,000 Dominicans according to 2018 estimates, 134,000 Puerto Ricans, 57,500 Salvadorans, 39,000 Guatemalans, 36,000 Mexicans, and over 35,000 Colombians.[169] East Boston has a diverse Hispanic/Latino population of Salvadorans, Colombians, Guatemalans, Mexicans, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans. Hispanic populations in southwest Boston neighborhoods are mainly made up of Dominicans and Puerto Ricans, usually sharing neighborhoods in this section with African Americans and Blacks with origins from the Caribbean and Africa especially Cape Verdeans and Haitians. Neighborhoods such as Jamaica Plain and Roslindale have experienced a growing number of Dominican Americans.[170] \nThere is a large and historical Armenian community in Boston,[171] and the city is home to the Armenian Heritage Park.[172] Additionally, over 27,000 Chinese Americans made their home in Boston city proper in 2013.[173] Overall, according to the 2012–2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, the largest ancestry groups in Boston are:[174][175] \nAncestry Percentage of\nBoston\npopulation Percentage of\nMassachusetts\npopulation Percentage of\nUnited States\npopulation City-to-state\ndifference City-to-USA\ndifference \nBlack \t22% \t8.2% \t14-15% \t13.8% \t7% \t\nIrish \t14.06% \t21.16% \t10.39% \t−7.10% \t3.67% \t\nItalian \t8.13% \t13.19% \t5.39% \t−5.05% \t2.74% \t\nother West Indian \t6.92% \t1.96% \t0.90% \t4.97% \t6.02% \t\nDominican \t5.45% \t2.60% \t0.68% \t2.65% \t4.57% \t\nPuerto Rican \t5.27% \t4.52% \t1.66% \t0.75% \t3.61% \t\nChinese \t4.57% \t2.28% \t1.24% \t2.29% \t3.33% \t\nGerman \t4.57% \t6.00% \t14.40% \t−1.43% \t−9.83% \t\nEnglish \t4.54% \t9.77% \t7.67% \t−5.23% \t−3.13% \t\nAmerican \t4.13% \t4.26% \t6.89% \t−0.13% \t−2.76% \t\nSub-Saharan African \t4.09% \t2.00% \t1.01% \t2.09% \t3.08% \t\nHaitian \t3.58% \t1.15% \t0.31% \t2.43% \t3.27% \t\nPolish \t2.48% \t4.67% \t2.93% \t−2.19% \t−0.45% \t\nCape Verdean \t2.21% \t0.97% \t0.03% \t1.24% \t2.18% \t\nFrench \t1.93% \t6.82% \t2.56% \t−4.89% \t−0.63% \t\nVietnamese \t1.76% \t0.69% \t0.54% \t1.07% \t1.22% \t\nJamaican \t1.70% \t0.44% \t0.34% \t1.26% \t1.36% \t\nRussian \t1.62% \t1.65% \t0.88% \t−0.03% \t0.74% \t\nAsian Indian \t1.31% \t1.39% \t1.09% \t−0.08% \t0.22% \t\nScottish \t1.30% \t2.28% \t1.71% \t−0.98% \t−0.41% \t\nFrench Canadian \t1.19% \t3.91% \t0.65% \t−2.71% \t0.54% \t\nMexican \t1.12% \t0.67% \t11.96% \t0.45% \t−10.84% \t\nArab \t1.10% \t1.10% \t0.59% \t0.00% \t0.50% \t\nData is from the 2008–2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.[176][177][178] \nRank ZIP Code (ZCTA) Per capita\nincome Median\nhousehold\nincome Median\nfamily\nincome Population Number of\nhouseholds \n1 \t02110 (Financial District) \t$152,007 \t$123,795 \t$196,518 \t1,486 \t981 \t\n2 \t02199 (Prudential Center) \t$151,060 \t$107,159 \t$146,786 \t1,290 \t823 \t\n3 \t02210 (Fort Point) \t$93,078 \t$111,061 \t$223,411 \t1,905 \t1,088 \t\n4 \t02109 (North End) \t$88,921 \t$128,022 \t$162,045 \t4,277 \t2,190 \t\n5 \t02116 (Back Bay/Bay Village) \t$81,458 \t$87,630 \t$134,875 \t21,318 \t10,938 \t\n6 \t02108 (Beacon Hill/Financial District) \t$78,569 \t$95,753 \t$153,618 \t4,155 \t2,337 \t\n7 \t02114 (Beacon Hill/West End) \t$65,865 \t$79,734 \t$169,107 \t11,933 \t6,752 \t\n8 \t02111 (Chinatown/Financial District/Leather District) \t$56,716 \t$44,758 \t$88,333 \t7,616 \t3,390 \t\n9 \t02129 (Charlestown) \t$56,267 \t$89,105 \t$98,445 \t17,052 \t8,083 \t\n10 \t02467 (Chestnut Hill) \t$53,382 \t$113,952 \t$148,396 \t22,796 \t6,351 \t\n11 \t02113 (North End) \t$52,905 \t$64,413 \t$112,589 \t7,276 \t4,329 \t\n12 \t02132 (West Roxbury) \t$44,306 \t$82,421 \t$110,219 \t27,163 \t11,013 \t\n13 \t02118 (South End) \t$43,887 \t$50,000 \t$49,090 \t26,779 \t12,512 \t\n14 \t02130 (Jamaica Plain) \t$42,916 \t$74,198 \t$95,426 \t36,866 \t15,306 \t\n15 \t02127 (South Boston) \t$42,854 \t$67,012 \t$68,110 \t32,547 \t14,994 \t\n\tMassachusetts \t$35,485 \t$66,658 \t$84,380 \t6,560,595 \t2,525,694 \t\n\tBoston \t$33,589 \t$53,136 \t$63,230 \t619,662 \t248,704 \t\n\tSuffolk County \t$32,429 \t$52,700 \t$61,796 \t724,502 \t287,442 \t\n16 \t02135 (Brighton) \t$31,773 \t$50,291 \t$62,602 \t38,839 \t18,336 \t\n17 \t02131 (Roslindale) \t$29,486 \t$61,099 \t$70,598 \t30,370 \t11,282 \t\n\tUnited States \t$28,051 \t$53,046 \t$64,585 \t309,138,711 \t115,226,802 \t\n18 \t02136 (Hyde Park) \t$28,009 \t$57,080 \t$74,734 \t29,219 \t10,650 \t\n19 \t02134 (Allston) \t$25,319 \t$37,638 \t$49,355 \t20,478 \t8,916 \t\n20 \t02128 (East Boston) \t$23,450 \t$49,549 \t$49,470 \t41,680 \t14,965 \t\n21 \t02122 (Dorchester-Fields Corner) \t$23,432 \t$51,798 \t$50,246 \t25,437 \t8,216 \t\n22 \t02124 (Dorchester-Codman Square-Ashmont) \t$23,115 \t$48,329 \t$55,031 \t49,867 \t17,275 \t\n23 \t02125 (Dorchester-Uphams Corner-Savin Hill) \t$22,158 \t$42,298 \t$44,397 \t31,996 \t11,481 \t\n24 \t02163 (Allston-Harvard Business School) \t$21,915 \t$43,889 \t$91,190 \t1,842 \t562 \t\n25 \t02115 (Back Bay, Longwood, Museum of Fine Arts/Symphony Hall area) \t$21,654 \t$23,677 \t$50,303 \t29,178 \t9,958 \t\n26 \t02126 (Mattapan) \t$20,649 \t$43,532 \t$52,774 \t27,335 \t9,510 \t\n27 \t02215 (Fenway-Kenmore) \t$19,082 \t$30,823 \t$72,583 \t23,719 \t7,995 \t\n28 \t02119 (Roxbury) \t$18,998 \t$27,051 \t$35,311 \t24,237 \t9,769 \t\n29 \t02121 (Dorchester-Mount Bowdoin) \t$18,226 \t$30,419 \t$35,439 \t26,801 \t9,739 \t\n30 \t02120 (Mission Hill) \t$17,390 \t$32,367 \t$29,583 \t13,217 \t4,509 \t\nOld South Church at Copley Square at sunset. This United Church of Christ congregation was first organized in 1669. \nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 57% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 25% attending a variety of Protestant churches and 29% professing Roman Catholic beliefs; 33% claim no religious affiliation, while the remaining 10% are composed of adherents of Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, and other faiths.[179][180] \nAs of 2010, the Catholic Church had the highest number of adherents as a single denomination in the Greater Boston area, with more than two million members and 339 churches, followed by the Episcopal Church with 58,000 adherents in 160 churches. The United Church of Christ had 55,000 members and 213 churches.[181] \nThe Boston metro area contained a Jewish population of approximately 248,000 as of 2015.[182] More than half the Jewish households in the Greater Boston area reside in the city itself, Brookline, Newton, Cambridge, Somerville, or adjacent towns.[182] A small minority practices Confucianism, and some practice Boston Confucianism, an American evolution of Confucianism adapted for Boston intellectuals.[183] \nA global city, Boston is placed among the top 30 most economically powerful cities in the world.[186] Encompassing $363 billion, the Greater Boston metropolitan area has the sixth-largest economy in the country and 12th-largest in the world.[187] \nBoston's colleges and universities exert a significant impact on the regional economy. Boston attracts more than 350,000 college students from around the world, who contribute more than US$4.8 billion annually to the city's economy.[188][189] The area's schools are major employers and attract industries to the city and surrounding region. The city is home to a number of technology companies and is a hub for biotechnology, with the Milken Institute rating Boston as the top life sciences cluster in the country.[190] Boston receives the highest absolute amount of annual funding from the National Institutes of Health of all cities in the United States.[191] \nThe city is considered highly innovative for a variety of reasons, including the presence of academia, access to venture capital, and the presence of many high-tech companies.[24][192] The Route 128 corridor and Greater Boston continue to be a major center for venture capital investment,[193] and high technology remains an important sector.[194] \nTourism also composes a large part of Boston's economy, with 21.2 million domestic and international visitors spending $8.3 billion in 2011.[195] Excluding visitors from Canada and Mexico, over 1.4 million international tourists visited Boston in 2014, with those from China and the United Kingdom leading the list.[196] Boston's status as a state capital as well as the regional home of federal agencies has rendered law and government to be another major component of the city's economy.[197] The city is a major seaport along the East Coast of the United States and the oldest continuously operated industrial and fishing port in the Western Hemisphere.[198] \nIn the 2018 Global Financial Centres Index, Boston was ranked as having the thirteenth most competitive financial services center in the world and the second most competitive in the United States.[199] Boston-based Fidelity Investments helped popularize the mutual fund in the 1980s and has made Boston one of the top financial centers in the United States.[200] The city is home to the headquarters of Santander Bank, and Boston is a center for venture capital firms. State Street Corporation, which specializes in asset management and custody services, is based in the city. Boston is a printing and publishing center[201]—Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is headquartered within the city, along with Bedford-St. Martin's Press and Beacon Press. Pearson PLC publishing units also employ several hundred people in Boston. The city is home to two convention centers—the Hynes Convention Center in the Back Bay and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center on the South Boston waterfront.[202] The General Electric Corporation announced in January 2016 its decision to move the company's global headquarters to the Seaport District in Boston, from Fairfield, Connecticut, citing factors including Boston's preeminence in the realm of higher education.[103] Boston is home to the headquarters of several major athletic and footwear companies including Converse, New Balance, and Reebok. Rockport, Puma and Wolverine World Wide, Inc. headquarters or regional offices[203] are just outside the city.[204] \nPrimary and secondary education\n[edit]\nBoston Latin School was established in 1635 and is the oldest public high school in the U.S. \nThe Boston Public Schools enroll 57,000 students attending 145 schools, including Boston Latin Academy, John D. O'Bryant School of Math & Science, and the renowned Boston Latin School. The Boston Latin School was established in 1635 and is the oldest public high school in the US. Boston also operates the United States' second-oldest public high school and its oldest public elementary school.[19] The system's students are 40% Hispanic or Latino, 35% Black or African American, 13% White, and 9% Asian.[205] There are private, parochial, and charter schools as well, and approximately 3,300 minority students attend participating suburban schools through the Metropolitan Educational Opportunity Council.[206] In September 2019, the city formally inaugurated Boston Saves, a program that provides every child enrolled in the city's kindergarten system a savings account containing $50 to be used toward college or career training.[207] \nMap of Boston-area universities Harvard Business School, one of the country's top business schools[208] \nSeveral of the most renowned and highly ranked universities in the world are near Boston.[209] Three universities with a major presence in the city, Harvard, MIT, and Tufts, are just outside of Boston in the cities of Cambridge and Somerville, known as the Brainpower Triangle.[210] Harvard is the nation's oldest institute of higher education and is centered across the Charles River in Cambridge, though the majority of its land holdings and a substantial amount of its educational activities are in Boston. Its business school and athletics facilities are in Boston's Allston neighborhood, and its medical, dental, and public health schools are located in the Longwood area.[211]The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) originated in Boston and was long known as \"Boston Tech\"; it moved across the river to Cambridge in 1916.[212] Tufts University's main campus is north of the city in Somerville and Medford, though it locates its medical and dental schools in Boston's Chinatown at Tufts Medical Center.[213] \nGreater Boston has more than 50 colleges and universities, with 250,000 students enrolled in Boston and Cambridge alone.[214] The city's largest private universities include Boston University (also the city's fourth-largest employer),[215] with its main campus along Commonwealth Avenue and a medical campus in the South End, Northeastern University in the Fenway area,[216] Suffolk University near Beacon Hill, which includes law school and business school,[217] and Boston College, which straddles the Boston (Brighton)–Newton border.[218] Boston's only public university is the University of Massachusetts Boston on Columbia Point in Dorchester. Roxbury Community College and Bunker Hill Community College are the city's two public community colleges. Altogether, Boston's colleges and universities employ more than 42,600 people, accounting for nearly seven percent of the city's workforce.[219] \nFive members of the Association of American Universities are in Greater Boston (more than any other metropolitan area): Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tufts University, Boston University, and Brandeis University.[220] Furthermore, Greater Boston contains seven Highest Research Activity (R1) Universities as per the Carnegie Classification. This includes, in addition to the aforementioned five, Boston College, and Northeastern University. This is, by a large margin, the highest concentration of such institutions in a single metropolitan area. Hospitals, universities, and research institutions in Greater Boston received more than $1.77 billion in National Institutes of Health grants in 2013, more money than any other American metropolitan area.[221] This high density of research institutes also contributes to Boston's high density of early career researchers, which, due to high housing costs in the region, have been shown to face housing stress.[222][223] \nSmaller private colleges include Babson College, Bentley University, Boston Architectural College, Emmanuel College, Fisher College, MGH Institute of Health Professions, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Simmons University, Wellesley College, Wheelock College, Wentworth Institute of Technology, New England School of Law (originally established as America's first all female law school),[224] and Emerson College.[225] The region is also home to several conservatories and art schools, including the New England Conservatory (the oldest independent conservatory in the United States),[226] the Boston Conservatory, and Berklee College of Music, which has made Boston an important city for jazz music.[227] Many trade schools also exist in the city, such as the Boston Career Institute, the North Bennet Street School, Greater Boston Joint Apprentice Training Center, and many others.[228] \nBoston City Hall is a Brutalist-style landmark in the city.\nBoston has a strong mayor–council government system in which the mayor (elected every fourth year) has extensive executive power. Michelle Wu became mayor in November 2021, succeeding Kim Janey who became the Acting Mayor in March 2021 following Marty Walsh's confirmation to the position of Secretary of Labor in the Biden/Harris Administration. Walsh's predecessor Thomas Menino's twenty-year tenure was the longest in the city's history.[229] The Boston City Council is elected every two years; there are nine district seats, and four citywide \"at-large\" seats.[230] The School Committee, which oversees the Boston Public Schools, is appointed by the mayor.[231] The city uses an algorithm called CityScore to measure the effectiveness of various city services. This score is available on a public online dashboard and allows city managers in police, fire, schools, emergency management services, and 3-1-1 to take action and make adjustments in areas of concern.[232] \nChamber of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in the Massachusetts State House \nIn addition to city government, numerous commissions and state authorities, including the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Boston Public Health Commission, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), and the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), play a role in the life of Bostonians. As the capital of Massachusetts, Boston plays a major role in state politics.[f] \nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston at 600 Atlantic Avenue \nThe city has several federal facilities, including the John F. Kennedy Federal Office Building, the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Federal Building, the John W. McCormack Post Office and Courthouse, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.[235] The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts are housed in The John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse.[236][237] \nFederally, Boston is split between two congressional districts. Three-fourths of the city is in the 7th district and is represented by Ayanna Pressley while the remaining southern fourth is in the 8th district and is represented by Stephen Lynch,[238] both of whom are Democrats; a Republican has not represented a significant portion of Boston in over a century. The state's senior member of the United States Senate is Democrat Elizabeth Warren, first elected in 2012.[239] The state's junior member of the United States Senate is Democrat Ed Markey, who was elected in 2013 to succeed John Kerry after Kerry's appointment and confirmation as the United States Secretary of State.[240] \nA Boston Police cruiser on Beacon Street \nBoston included $414 million in spending on the Boston Police Department in the fiscal 2021 budget. This is the second largest allocation of funding by the city after the allocation to Boston Public Schools.[241] \nLike many major American cities, Boston has experienced a great reduction in violent crime since the early 1990s. Boston's low crime rate since the 1990s has been credited to the Boston Police Department's collaboration with neighborhood groups and church parishes to prevent youths from joining gangs, as well as involvement from the United States Attorney and District Attorney's offices. This helped lead in part to what has been touted as the \"Boston Miracle\". Murders in the city dropped from 152 in 1990 (for a murder rate of 26.5 per 100,000 people) to just 31—not one of them a juvenile—in 1999 (for a murder rate of 5.26 per 100,000).[242] \nIn 2008, there were 62 reported homicides.[243] Through December 30, 2016, major crime was down seven percent and there were 46 homicides compared to 40 in 2015.[244] \nThe Old State House, a museum on the Freedom Trail near the site of the Boston Massacre In the 19th century, the Old Corner Bookstore became a gathering place for writers, including Emerson, Thoreau, and Margaret Fuller. James Russell Lowell printed the first editions of The Atlantic Monthly at the store. Symphony Hall at 301 Massachusetts Avenue, home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra Museum of Fine Arts at 465 Huntington Avenue \nBoston shares many cultural roots with greater New England, including a dialect of the non-rhotic Eastern New England accent known as the Boston accent[245] and a regional cuisine with a large emphasis on seafood, salt, and dairy products.[246] Boston also has its own collection of neologisms known as Boston slang and sardonic humor.[247] \nIn the early 1800s, William Tudor wrote that Boston was \"'perhaps the most perfect and certainly the best-regulated democracy that ever existed. There is something so impossible in the immortal fame of Athens, that the very name makes everything modern shrink from comparison; but since the days of that glorious city I know of none that has approached so near in some points, distant as it may still be from that illustrious model.'[248] From this, Boston has been called the \"Athens of America\" (also a nickname of Philadelphia)[249] for its literary culture, earning a reputation as \"the intellectual capital of the United States\".[250] \nIn the nineteenth century, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Margaret Fuller, James Russell Lowell, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote in Boston. Some consider the Old Corner Bookstore to be the \"cradle of American literature\", the place where these writers met and where The Atlantic Monthly was first published.[251] In 1852, the Boston Public Library was founded as the first free library in the United States.[250] Boston's literary culture continues today thanks to the city's many universities and the Boston Book Festival.[252][253] \nMusic is afforded a high degree of civic support in Boston. The Boston Symphony Orchestra is one of the \"Big Five\", a group of the greatest American orchestras, and the classical music magazine Gramophone called it one of the \"world's best\" orchestras.[254] Symphony Hall (west of Back Bay) is home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the related Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra, which is the largest youth orchestra in the nation,[255] and to the Boston Pops Orchestra. The British newspaper The Guardian called Boston Symphony Hall \"one of the top venues for classical music in the world\", adding \"Symphony Hall in Boston was where science became an essential part of concert hall design\".[256] Other concerts are held at the New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall. The Boston Ballet performs at the Boston Opera House. Other performing-arts organizations in the city include the Boston Lyric Opera Company, Opera Boston, Boston Baroque (the first permanent Baroque orchestra in the US),[257] and the Handel and Haydn Society (one of the oldest choral companies in the United States).[258] The city is a center for contemporary classical music with a number of performing groups, several of which are associated with the city's conservatories and universities. These include the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Boston Musica Viva.[257] Several theaters are in or near the Theater District south of Boston Common, including the Cutler Majestic Theatre, Citi Performing Arts Center, the Colonial Theater, and the Orpheum Theatre.[259] \nThere are several major annual events, such as First Night which occurs on New Year's Eve, the Boston Early Music Festival, the annual Boston Arts Festival at Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park, the annual Boston gay pride parade and festival held in June, and Italian summer feasts in the North End honoring Catholic saints.[260] The city is the site of several events during the Fourth of July period. They include the week-long Harborfest festivities[261] and a Boston Pops concert accompanied by fireworks on the banks of the Charles River.[262] \nSeveral historic sites relating to the American Revolution period are preserved as part of the Boston National Historical Park because of the city's prominent role. Many are found along the Freedom Trail,[263] which is marked by a red line of bricks embedded in the ground.[264] \nThe city is also home to several art museums and galleries, including the Museum of Fine Arts and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.[265] The Institute of Contemporary Art is housed in a contemporary building designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro in the Seaport District.[266] Boston's South End Art and Design District (SoWa) and Newbury St. are both art gallery destinations.[267][268] Columbia Point is the location of the University of Massachusetts Boston, the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, and the Massachusetts Archives and Commonwealth Museum. The Boston Athenæum (one of the oldest independent libraries in the United States),[269] Boston Children's Museum, Bull & Finch Pub (whose building is known from the television show Cheers),[270] Museum of Science, and the New England Aquarium are within the city.[271] \nBoston has been a noted religious center from its earliest days. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston serves nearly 300 parishes and is based in the Cathedral of the Holy Cross (1875) in the South End, while the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts serves just under 200 congregations, with the Cathedral Church of St. Paul (1819) as its episcopal seat. Unitarian Universalism has its headquarters in the Fort Point neighborhood. The Christian Scientists are headquartered in Back Bay at the Mother Church (1894). The oldest church in Boston is First Church in Boston, founded in 1630.[272] King's Chapel was the city's first Anglican church, founded in 1686 and converted to Unitarianism in 1785. Other churches include Old South Church (1669), Christ Church (better known as Old North Church, 1723), the oldest church building in the city, Trinity Church (1733), Park Street Church (1809), and Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help on Mission Hill (1878).[273] \nFenway Park, the home stadium of the Boston Red Sox. Opened in 1912, Fenway Park is the oldest professional baseball stadium still in use. \nBoston has teams in the four major North American men's professional sports leagues plus Major League Soccer. As of 2024, the city has won 40 championships in these leagues. During a 23-year stretch from 2001 to 2024, the city's professional sports teams have won thirteen championships: Patriots (2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016 and 2018), Red Sox (2004, 2007, 2013, and 2018), Celtics (2008, 2024), and Bruins (2011).[274] \nThe Boston Red Sox, a founding member of the American League of Major League Baseball in 1901, play their home games at Fenway Park, near Kenmore Square, in the city's Fenway section. Built in 1912, it is the oldest sports arena or stadium in active use in the United States among the four major professional American sports leagues, Major League Baseball, the National Football League, National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League.[275] Boston was the site of the first game of the first modern World Series, in 1903. The series was played between the AL Champion Boston Americans and the NL champion Pittsburgh Pirates.[276][277] Persistent reports that the team was known in 1903 as the \"Boston Pilgrims\" appear to be unfounded.[278] Boston's first professional baseball team was the Red Stockings, one of the charter members of the National Association in 1871, and of the National League in 1876. The team played under that name until 1883, under the name Beaneaters until 1911, and under the name Braves from 1912 until they moved to Milwaukee after the 1952 season. Since 1966 they have played in Atlanta as the Atlanta Braves.[279] \nThe Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association play at TD Garden \nThe TD Garden, formerly called the FleetCenter and built to replace the since-demolished Boston Garden, is above North Station and is the home of two major league teams: the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League and the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association. The Bruins were the first American member of the National Hockey League and an Original Six franchise.[280] The Boston Celtics were founding members of the Basketball Association of America, one of the two leagues that merged to form the NBA.[281] The Celtics have won eighteen championships, the most of any NBA team.[282] \nWhile they have played in suburban Foxborough since 1971, the New England Patriots of the National Football League were founded in 1960 as the Boston Patriots, changing their name after relocating. The team won the Super Bowl after the 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016 and 2018 seasons.[283] They share Gillette Stadium with the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer.[284] \nHarvard Stadium, the first collegiate athletic stadium built in the U.S. \nThe area's many colleges and universities are active in college athletics. Four NCAA Division I members play in the area—Boston College, Boston University, Harvard University, and Northeastern University. Of the four, only Boston College participates in college football at the highest level, the Football Bowl Subdivision. Harvard participates in the second-highest level, the Football Championship Subdivision. These four universities participate in the Beanpot, an annual men's and women's ice hockey tournament. The men's Beanpot is hosted at the TD Garden,[285] while the women's Beanpot is held at each member school's home arena on a rotating basis.[286] \nBoston has Esports teams as well, such as the Overwatch League (OWL)'s Boston Uprising. Established in 2017,[287] they were the first team to complete a perfect stage with 0 losses.[288] The Boston Breach is another esports team in the Call of Duty League (CDL).[289] \nOne of the best-known sporting events in the city is the Boston Marathon, the 26.2 mi (42.2 km) race which is the world's oldest annual marathon,[290] run on Patriots' Day in April. The Red Sox traditionally play a home game starting around 11 A.M. on the same day, with the early start time allowing fans to watch runners finish the race nearby after the conclusion of the ballgame.[291] Another major annual event is the Head of the Charles Regatta, held in October.[292] \nMajor sports teams \nTeam League Sport Venue Capacity Founded Championships \nBoston Red Sox MLB \tBaseball \tFenway Park \t37,755 \t1903 \t1903, 1912, 1915, 1916, 1918, 2004, 2007, 2013, 2018 \t\nBoston Bruins NHL \tIce hockey \tTD Garden \t17,850 \t1924 \t1928–29, 1938–39, 1940–41, 1969–70, 1971–72, 2010–11 \t\nBoston Celtics NBA \tBasketball \tTD Garden \t19,156 \t1946 \t1956–57, 1958–59, 1959–60, 1960–61, 1961–62, 1962–63, 1963–64, 1964–65, 1965–66, 1967–68, 1968–69, 1973–74, 1975–76, 1980–81, 1983–84, 1985–86, 2007–08, 2023–24 \t\nNew England Patriots NFL \tAmerican football \tGillette Stadium \t65,878 \t1960 \t2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, 2018 \t\nNew England Revolution MLS \tSoccer \tGillette Stadium \t20,000 \t1996 \tNone \t\nParks and recreation\n[edit]\nAerial view of Boston Common in Downtown Boston \nBoston Common, near the Financial District and Beacon Hill, is the oldest public park in the United States.[293] Along with the adjacent Boston Public Garden, it is part of the Emerald Necklace, a string of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted to run through the city. The Emerald Necklace includes the Back Bay Fens, Arnold Arboretum, Jamaica Pond, Boston's largest body of freshwater, and Franklin Park, the city's largest park and home of the Franklin Park Zoo.[294] Another major park is the Esplanade, along the banks of the Charles River. The Hatch Shell, an outdoor concert venue, is adjacent to the Charles River Esplanade. Other parks are scattered throughout the city, with major parks and beaches near Castle Island and the south end, in Charlestown and along the Dorchester, South Boston, and East Boston shorelines.[295] \nBoston's park system is well-reputed nationally. In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land reported Boston was tied with Sacramento and San Francisco for having the third-best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities. ParkScore ranks city park systems by a formula that analyzes the city's median park size, park acres as percent of city area, the percent of residents within a half-mile of a park, spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds per 10,000 residents.[296] \nThe Boston Globe is the oldest and largest daily newspaper in the city[297] and is generally acknowledged as its paper of record.[298] The city is also served by other publications such as the Boston Herald, Boston magazine, DigBoston, and the Boston edition of Metro. The Christian Science Monitor, headquartered in Boston, was formerly a worldwide daily newspaper but ended publication of daily print editions in 2009, switching to continuous online and weekly magazine format publications.[299] The Boston Globe also releases a teen publication to the city's public high schools, called Teens in Print or T.i.P., which is written by the city's teens and delivered quarterly within the school year.[300] The Improper Bostonian, a glossy lifestyle magazine, was published from 1991 through April 2019. \nThe city's growing Latino population has given rise to a number of local and regional Spanish-language newspapers. These include El Planeta (owned by the former publisher of the Boston Phoenix), El Mundo, and La Semana. Siglo21, with its main offices in nearby Lawrence, is also widely distributed.[301] \nVarious LGBT publications serve the city's large LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) population such as The Rainbow Times, the only minority and lesbian-owned LGBT news magazine. Founded in 2006, The Rainbow Times is now based out of Boston, but serves all of New England.[302] \nRadio and television\n[edit]\nBoston is the largest broadcasting market in New England, with the radio market being the ninth largest in the United States.[303] Several major AM stations include talk radio WRKO, sports/talk station WEEI, and news radio WBZ (AM). WBZ is a 50,000 watt \"clear channel\" station whose nighttime broadcasts are heard hundreds of miles from Boston.[304] A variety of commercial FM radio formats serve the area, as do NPR stations WBUR and WGBH. College and university radio stations include WERS (Emerson), WHRB (Harvard), WUMB (UMass Boston), WMBR (MIT), WZBC (Boston College), WMFO (Tufts University), WBRS (Brandeis University), WRBB (Northeastern University) and WMLN-FM (Curry College).[305] \nThe Boston television DMA, which also includes Manchester, New Hampshire, is the eighth largest in the United States.[306] The city is served by stations representing every major American network, including WBZ-TV 4 and its sister station WSBK-TV 38 (the former a CBS O&O, the latter an independent station), WCVB-TV 5 and its sister station WMUR-TV 9 (both ABC), WHDH 7 and its sister station WLVI 56 (the former an independent station, the latter a CW affiliate), WBTS-CD 15 (an NBC O&O), and WFXT 25 (Fox). The city is also home to PBS member station WGBH-TV 2, a major producer of PBS programs,[307] which also operates WGBX 44. Spanish-language television networks, including UniMás (WUTF-TV 27), Telemundo (WNEU 60, a sister station to WBTS-CD), and Univisión (WUNI 66), have a presence in the region, with WNEU serving as network owned-and-operated station. Most of the area's television stations have their transmitters in nearby Needham and Newton along the Route 128 corridor.[308] Seven Boston television stations are carried by satellite television and cable television providers in Canada.[309] \nHarvard Medical School, one of the world's most prestigious medical schools \nMany of Boston's medical facilities are associated with universities. The Longwood Medical and Academic Area, adjacent to the Fenway, district, is home to a large number of medical and research facilities, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, and Joslin Diabetes Center.[310] Prominent medical facilities, including Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital are in the Beacon Hill area. Many of the facilities in Longwood and near Massachusetts General Hospital are affiliated with Harvard Medical School.[311] \nTufts Medical Center (formerly Tufts-New England Medical Center), in the southern portion of the Chinatown neighborhood, is affiliated with Tufts University School of Medicine. Boston Medical Center, in the South End neighborhood, is the region's largest safety-net hospital and trauma center. Formed by the merger of Boston City Hospital, the first municipal hospital in the United States, and Boston University Hospital, Boston Medical Center now serves as the primary teaching facility for the Boston University School of Medicine.[312][313] St. Elizabeth's Medical Center is in Brighton Center of the city's Brighton neighborhood. New England Baptist Hospital is in Mission Hill. The city has Veterans Affairs medical centers in the Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury neighborhoods.[314] \nAn MBTA Red Line train departing Boston for Cambridge. Over 1.3 million Bostonians utilize the city's buses and trains daily as of 2013.[315] \nLogan International Airport, in East Boston and operated by the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), is Boston's principal airport.[316] Nearby general aviation airports are Beverly Regional Airport and Lawrence Municipal Airport to the north, Hanscom Field to the west, and Norwood Memorial Airport to the south.[317] Massport also operates several major facilities within the Port of Boston, including a cruise ship terminal and facilities to handle bulk and container cargo in South Boston, and other facilities in Charlestown and East Boston.[318] \nDowntown Boston's streets grew organically, so they do not form a planned grid,[319] unlike those in later-developed Back Bay, East Boston, the South End, and South Boston. Boston is the eastern terminus of I-90, which in Massachusetts runs along the Massachusetts Turnpike. The Central Artery follows I-93 as the primary north–south artery that carries most of the through traffic in downtown Boston. Other major highways include US 1, which carries traffic to the North Shore and areas south of Boston, US 3, which connects to the northwestern suburbs, Massachusetts Route 3, which connects to the South Shore and Cape Cod, and Massachusetts Route 2 which connects to the western suburbs. Surrounding the city is Massachusetts Route 128, a partial beltway which has been largely subsumed by other routes (mostly I-95 and I-93).[320] \nWith nearly a third of Bostonians using public transit for their commute to work, Boston has the fourth-highest rate of public transit usage in the country.[321] The city of Boston has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2016, 33.8 percent of Boston households lacked a car, compared with the national average of 8.7 percent. The city averaged 0.94 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.[322] Boston's public transportation agency, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), operates the oldest underground rapid transit system in the Americas and is the fourth-busiest rapid transit system in the country,[20] with 65.5 mi (105 km) of track on four lines.[323] The MBTA also operates busy bus and commuter rail networks as well as water shuttles.[323] \nSouth Station, the busiest rail hub in New England, is a terminus of Amtrak and numerous MBTA rail lines. \nAmtrak intercity rail to Boston is provided through four stations: South Station, North Station, Back Bay, and Route 128. South Station is a major intermodal transportation hub and is the terminus of Amtrak's Northeast Regional, Acela Express, and Lake Shore Limited routes, in addition to multiple MBTA services. Back Bay is also served by MBTA and those three Amtrak routes, while Route 128, in the southwestern suburbs of Boston, is only served by the Acela Express and Northeast Regional.[324] Meanwhile, Amtrak's Downeaster to Brunswick, Maine terminates in North Station, and is the only Amtrak route to do so.[325] \nNicknamed \"The Walking City\", Boston hosts more pedestrian commuters than do other comparably populated cities. Owing to factors such as necessity, the compactness of the city and large student population, 13 percent of the population commutes by foot, making it the highest percentage of pedestrian commuters in the country out of the major American cities.[326] As of 2024, Walk Score ranks Boston as the third most walkable U.S. city, with a Walk Score of 83, a Transit Score of 72, and a Bike Score of 69.[327] \nBluebikes in Boston \nBetween 1999 and 2006, Bicycling magazine named Boston three times as one of the worst cities in the U.S. for cycling;[328] regardless, it has one of the highest rates of bicycle commuting.[329] In 2008, as a consequence of improvements made to bicycling conditions within the city, the same magazine put Boston on its \"Five for the Future\" list as a \"Future Best City\" for biking,[330][331] and Boston's bicycle commuting percentage increased from 1% in 2000 to 2.1% in 2009.[332] The bikeshare program Bluebikes, originally called Hubway, launched in late July 2011,[333] logging more than 140,000 rides before the close of its first season.[334] The neighboring municipalities of Cambridge, Somerville, and Brookline joined the Hubway program in the summer of 2012.[335] In 2016, there were 1,461 bikes and 158 docking stations across the city, which in 2022 has increased to 400 stations with a total of 4,000 bikes.[336] PBSC Urban Solutions provides bicycles and technology for this bike-sharing system.[337] \nInternational relations\n[edit]\nThe City of Boston has eleven official sister cities:[338] \nKyoto, Japan (1959)\nStrasbourg, France (1960)\nBarcelona, Spain (1980)\nHangzhou, China (1982)\nPadua, Italy (1983)\nCity of Melbourne, Australia (1985)\nBeira, Mozambique (1990)\nTaipei, Taiwan (1996)\nSekondi-Takoradi, Ghana (2001)\nBelfast, Northern Ireland (2014)\nPraia, Cape Verde (2015)\nBoston has formal partnership relationships through a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) with five additional cities or regions: \nOutline of Boston\nBoston City League (high-school athletic conference)\nBoston Citgo Sign\nBoston nicknames\nBoston–Halifax relations\nList of diplomatic missions in Boston\nList of people from Boston\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Boston\nUSS Boston, seven ships\n^ The average number of days with a low at or below freezing is 94. \n^ Seasonal snowfall accumulation has ranged from 9.0 in (22.9 cm) in 1936–37 to 110.6 in (2.81 m) in 2014–15. \n^ Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020. \n^ Official records for Boston were kept at downtown from January 1872 to December 1935, and at Logan Airport (KBOS) since January 1936.[140] \n^ Jump up to: a b From 15% sample \n^ Since the Massachusetts State House is located in the city's Beacon Hill neighborhood, the term \"Beacon Hill\" is used as a metonym for the Massachusetts state government.[233][234] \n^ \"List of intact or abandoned Massachusetts county governments\". sec.state.ma.us.

The Boston Tea Party was a key event leading up to the revolution, as the British government responded furiously with the [Coercive Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerable_Acts \"Intolerable Acts\"), demanding compensation for the destroyed tea from the Bostonians.[\\[48\\]](#cite_note-newamernation-48) This angered the colonists further and led to the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American Revolutionary War\").

The New England militia impeded the movement of the [British Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army \"British Army\"). [Sir William Howe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howe,_5th_Viscount_Howe \"William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe\"), then the commander-in-chief of the British forces in North America, led the British army in the siege. On June 17, the British captured Charlestown (now part of Boston) during the [Battle of Bunker Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bunker_Hill \"Battle of Bunker Hill\"). The British army outnumbered the militia stationed there, but it was a [pyrrhic victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory \"Pyrrhic victory\") for the British because their army suffered irreplaceable casualties. It was also a testament to the skill and training of the militia, as their stubborn defense made it difficult for the British to capture Charlestown without suffering further irreplaceable casualties.[\\[54\\]](#cite_note-allemn-54)[\\[55\\]](#cite_note-1776book-55)\n\nSeveral weeks later, [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\") took over the militia after the [Continental Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Congress \"Continental Congress\") established the [Continental Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army \"Continental Army\") to unify the revolutionary effort. Both sides faced difficulties and supply shortages in the siege, and the fighting was limited to small-scale raids and skirmishes. The narrow Boston Neck, which at that time was only about a hundred feet wide, impeded Washington's ability to invade Boston, and a long stalemate ensued. A young officer, [Rufus Putnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufus_Putnam \"Rufus Putnam\"), came up with a plan to make portable fortifications out of wood that could be erected on the frozen ground under cover of darkness. Putnam supervised this effort, which successfully installed both the fortifications and dozens of cannons on [Dorchester Heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorchester_Heights \"Dorchester Heights\") that [Henry Knox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Knox \"Henry Knox\") had laboriously brought through the snow from [Fort Ticonderoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Ticonderoga \"Fort Ticonderoga\"). The astonished British awoke the next morning to see a large array of cannons bearing down on them. General Howe is believed to have said that the Americans had done more in one night than his army could have done in six months. The British Army attempted a cannon barrage for two hours, but their shot could not reach the colonists' cannons at such a height. The British gave up, boarded their ships, and sailed away. This has become known as \"[Evacuation Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuation_Day_\\(Massachusetts\\) \"Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)\")\", which Boston still celebrates each year on March 17.

Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the meantime. Manufacturing became an important component of the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century.
